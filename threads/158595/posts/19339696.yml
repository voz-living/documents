  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJay, thank you for your clarification. That you used synonyms in those sentences, which talks about someone&apos;s marriage, is damn good. Of course, &quot;to be intended&quot; means &quot;to be expected&quot; or &quot;to be planned&quot;. Your last example was cool, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we got a problem here - again. You didn&apos;t focus on the &quot;bold&quot; or &quot;self&quot; meaning of the subjects when they say &quot;I&apos;m intended to...&quot;. Like you pointed out above, &quot;He&apos;s expected to do&quot; or &quot;He&apos;s planned to do&quot; means someone expects him to do something or plans something for him to do. But we don&apos;t know for sure whether or not he has agreed or accepted to do that. So, we need a confirmation, and I&apos;m gonna ask a question like, <i>&quot;Really? Did he nod his head yet?&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;Really? Are you sure he&apos;s gonna do what he&apos;s expected to do?&quot;</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it would be a sure thing if we said &quot;to be intended&quot;.\r\n\t\t"
