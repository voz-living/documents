    dear ex,

    you may forget it, but I don't. it sounds stupid but I still remember that
    the mid autumn last year was the first time you texted me, then invited me
    to going out 

    I didn't like you at all because you seemed to be so stupid and hollow also.
    yes, really. I looked down on you. I saw the way you used your phone (ip4 -
    white. I had a bad impression on it. a kind of bias) and I thought that you
    meant to be swanky . At that time, I talked to you in the most ironic way
    that made you irritated. the more you got annoyed, the more I felt gloated  
    but you can't deny that everything I said was so true 

    well, then we became a kind of friend. you shared me almost all of your
    problem in work, in life by many messages. I replied your texts in an
    indefferent way as I still didn't like you. I acted as I was senior, I gave
    you advices. 

    you invited me to go out, to see a movie, to come to a concert... but I just
    simply refuse all. no matter how early you asked, I was busy 


    as time went by, I allowed myself to open my mind. I accepted to go out with
    you. actually I thought that going out with you wasn't wrong. there was no
    harm so I should take time to enjoy a movie (I really mean enjoy the movie,
    because you are the most uninteresting man I've ever talked to) 


    I don't remember exactly the time, but it may be in the mid-winter, when it
    came to my mind, you were still an idiot, but purely honest. I could felt
    that you were a staunch man, I trusted you.


    and I knew that you liked me but pretend to be innocent  

    even when you asked me:

    - what if I turn to love you?

    - none of my business 

    - but how do you feel about that?

    - none of your business 


    ... now it's just a piece of memory


    (one of my friends told me that I was your step mother )


    I want you to know that after breaking up with you, I have a more positive
    life  I study for the examination, participate in a competition and even get
    a part time job at the same time. let's guess the results I've got. Just
    amazing    


    now I've learnt how to live better 

    I have friends, true friends who can share me almost everything, beside a
    happy family with full of caring from my parents. I earn money by myself,
    and also have a kind of relationship  


    In detail, he's in my age. therefore he doesn't have to worry about how to
    aim target in work (you have told me many of them, with debt, loans,
    standing order, direct debit... it's enought for me). he can spend time on
    sharing many things with me...


    you texted me to notice about the end of our relationship. I used to think
    that it was too bad. but now I realize how lucky I am when you give me a
    chance to give up on you. I deserve more. yes I do. I really do.


    one or two days, before another mid-autumn
