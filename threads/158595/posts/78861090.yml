But then again, the feeling that I&apos;m destroying myself by smoking only makes my anxieties worse. Fuck me, like everything tries to screw me over.

If you can&apos;t hit your money maker and you only have a child, who to beat when your gambling went wrong, your job is shit, and you need to take it on somebody?

We&apos;re all thieves, we don&apos;t &quot;earn&quot; things, you just steal them from somebody else. You get a good job? You stole that from somebody else. You got a raise? you stole that from someone who just got fired. Only thing that matters is that can you be a better thief? Fuck it, We&apos;re not paying our skills, our knowledges and other bullshits to earn a virtual thing called &quot;money&quot;, we&apos;re paying time of our lives to get it.
