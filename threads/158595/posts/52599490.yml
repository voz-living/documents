    It's the basis of the gun, the skeleton that defines a gun's purpose. The
    mechanism of guns is basically the same, you trigger a brute force to
    brutally force the bullet go into a defined direction. But the basis creates
    a strong stand point in which a gun is used imho. LMG, SMG, Assault Rifle,
    sniper rifle's sizes are all different because of the difference in size.
