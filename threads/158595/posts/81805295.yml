This is not the first time I&apos;ve made a comment here, but rather the first time I use this account to comment in this topic <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"> I think everyday we can discuss about a specific topic, which will be extremely useful for all of us in terms of not only helping us to use English better but also giving us a deeper insight into things around the world. The topics can be anything ranging from science, literature, policy to even sex or future. By the way, I am currently preparing for the IELTS test in December this year, so anyone interested in learning English or looking for a partner to practice can contact me via Skype ( please ib me). I really desire to speak to a native speaker regularly, maybe through Skype, but it is a fairly challenging task for me &apos;cause I don&apos;t know how I can find such those people who are willing to talk to me.\r\n\t\t"
