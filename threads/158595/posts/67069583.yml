I got about 800 points, and my listening&apos;s point was always higher than reading&apos;s, and i didn&apos;t use as much time as they provided for one test ( i finished one test about 70~80 minutes, the actual test is 75 (reading) + 45 (listening), so with that result, how many point could i reach when i do a real test? Btw, i need at least 500.\r\n\t\t"

    hi guys, i've recently been doing few sample toeic tests on the internet. I
    got about 800 points, and my listening's point was always higher than
    reading's, and i didn't use as much time as they provided for one test ( i
    finished one test about 70~80 minutes, the actual test is 75 (reading) + 45
    (listening), so with that result, how many point could i reach when i do a
    real test? Btw, i need at least 500.
