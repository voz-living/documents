    Why don't you try writing your diary in English? Or the same way with every
    daily email? I enjoy reading news from the foreign press and Eng magazines
    such as BBC News, CNN, Financial Times... It's a good way to collect
    information and sharpen Eng skill at the same time, I think so. Besides, the
    terminology as well as the ornate and academic style might be accumulated by
    this approach. Try it now!
