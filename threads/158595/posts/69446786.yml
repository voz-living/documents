I still remember the day I went to my high school, the day I graduated. BTW, anyone having your first love in high school, can you share your story ? So I go first. I used to love a girl, same class with me. She was very bad at English. One day, our class had a 15-min test. It was kinda easy for me, but then I looked at her (she sat in front of me), the paper was blank. I took all of my bravery and gave her my paper. Yep, the teacher saw and we was punished. She admited that she couldn&apos;t do the test, but she didn&apos;t tell the teacher I was the one who had given her the paper. She said she had taken that from me. I was very embarrassed. Then, I thought that I could do more to help her to get better on English. We learned together every Saturday evening. In summer, we used Yahoo! Messenger to chat because both I and her were not allowed to use mobile phone. How innocent it was compared to those kind of relationships nowadays. Anyway, after graduation from high school, I continued my study abroad and we lost connection until 2010, I had a friend request with a familiar name. Yes that was her. Now, she&apos;s working at Sacombank and I heard that she&apos;s having a boyfriend too.
