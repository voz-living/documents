    @ Jay, my teacher is from the USA, and he said, in formal writing or
    academic writing, should not use pronouns like "I", "you",... And although
    it's your personal idea, the expression should be used objectively. For
    example, instead of using "As I mentioned above", you should write "As
    mentioned above".
