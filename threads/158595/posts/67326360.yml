The subjunctive of English today, though still exists, only evinces itself under some special circumstances - like the unreal / hypothetical conditional sentences and some expressions of desire, necessity, suggestion and purpose such as :<br>\r\n&quot; If I were you, I would ... &quot; <br>\r\n&quot; I insist the he be here. &quot;<br>\r\n&quot; It is necessary that it be fixed. &quot;<br>\r\nHowever, these constructions are rarely used in coloquial language and are considered formal or high language.
