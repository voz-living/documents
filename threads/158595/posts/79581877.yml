Hey dude, I have never encountered a guy as desperate as you. You know what, all of that trash talk just give you a tag of &quot;small mind&quot;, a selfish guy who does not want to give away anything without gaining something back in return. You get paid for doing nothing, that&apos;s not my problem nor is it anyone else&apos;s problem. Yo mama taught you &quot;you get what you give&quot; ? Thank you, your mom is a wise woman however her son isn&apos;t. I give out help, I receive help back in return. Does that make sense to you ? I thank you for recognizing my mental illness, because helping others for no reason is an illness then I would gladly accept it, you can crawl back in your little hole of a mind and sleep in there. I will not seek medical attention to cure this illness of mine as I can see the result post-treatment from you man. Many people donated to charity without actually seeing their money being put into good use, are they all mentally ill ? Who hurt you so bad that you turned out to be this hopeless ? Look at your comments, did you even give me a reasonable explanation on why I should not have helped ? However I can tell you this, helping him posted no threat to my family or my future whatsoever nor did it take a lot of my time, to be honest I was shitting while typing up that post instead of browsing the web reading trash comments like yours. I did not get offended by your comment, it just made me curious on how life can be so entertaining, you are a rare breed my son, a rare breed indeed. You brought up my insecurity ? Ha ha ha dude I have everything I could ever wanted, it was just that life took me by surprise by introducing you to me <img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
