One thing I was different from you is that my classmates liked me <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\"> as I was always available if they needed some support.

Only thing I know for sure now is that &quot;time is the most valuable thing in the world&quot;. I don&apos;t have enough time for my job, my family and my studying. Yes, studying.
