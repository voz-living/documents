Ex: you&apos;re 1m80 and she&apos;s 1m50. Don&apos;t mention her beauty or personality, just consider you have a gf in this situation (or you already have). Are you ever afraid that your children will be short? or any thing that you might think of. Feel free to tell me your point of view. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
