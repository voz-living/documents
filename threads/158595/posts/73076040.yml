I tell her that I am very poor. She tell me she does not care about that. I do not like her much all about her appearance and personality. Then, I tell her that I am in debt and now  I am in trouble If I do not pay him at one. And so, she says she has money but it is the money for business, not free money. I try to express that I am in deep shit and if I don&apos;t have that money, they will chop me out in pieces. She say, that is my problem, not her, and she block me. LOL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, you see, if you do not want to see someone, just try my pill.\r\n\t\t"
