I&#x2019;m feeling so lazy.<br>\r\nAnd when I&#x2019;ve just woke up, I feel something like missing home. My memories about when I was a high school&#x2019;s student are very sweet and everytime I think about it, I wanna come back to that time. But it&#x2019;s time to let it go and start to study for a better GPA.\r\n\t\t"
