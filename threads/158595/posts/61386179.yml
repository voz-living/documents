    I intend to set up a english speaking group.

    At the moment there are 4-5 people ready to join, and we will speak about a
    selected topic each session. But i think if there are no additional
    activites, it''s so boring.

    Does anybody here have experience in this? Can you help me to push some
    ideas?
