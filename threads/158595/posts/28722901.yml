I&apos;m not sure that I can handle the writing part. <b>So, would you mind sharing with me some website which helps students fix essay?</b> I really need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, I want to ask you guys, if you have time, help me fix this essay I&apos;ve just done. Thank you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTopic: <b>Forests are the lungs of the earth.

Generally, carbon dioxide is absorbed by trees, which prevents the greenhouse effect. However, the number of these filter machines are decreasing continually, leaving many troubles in which there is global warming.

People all know that trees protect them from flood by keeping a large amount of water, or drought by maintaining the humidity of the world. However, it seems like our efficient shield is broken by ourselves. According to many scientists, in this century, people have to suffer a lot of disasters, proved by the Tsunami in Thailand, or by the earthquakes in Haiti and Japan. Eventually, the unavoidable results are poverty, starvation, losing home and death, which affects seriously the human lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually important, not only is the human affected but the animals are also related firmly to the trees in global ecology system. If the forests disappear, there is an enormous amount of animals having to witness the condition of no habitation and the deficiency of food, inevitably.
