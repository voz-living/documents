    I'm too tired of the boredom I reluctantly spread all over my
    not-so-miserable life. Perhaps it would be better if I was forced into some
    desperate situation. Somehow, I have some fainted faith that from there, I
    can get over my dreadful laziness to finally start moving forward. A
    acceptable job with a so-so salary does nothing good for me than misleading
    about an ever-changing happiness. Deep down, I know tomorrow will eventually
    come together with its precarious nature and when that uncertainty arrives,
    my self-delusional bubble will burst. Shards of the broken temporary
    achievement which I partially don't deserve will lacerate my will-be-wounded
    self-esteem and leave me paralysed in bitter disappointment. However, vision
    of those vicious nightmares still not possess enough of a mass to pull me
    from the status-quo. I still let time slip through my finger gaps and waste
    in some pendantic matters of daily life. Can I void the becoming-inevitable
    destination?
