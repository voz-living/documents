Beforehand, I had never got any part-time job, as it&apos;s really a weak point for every student at my age; but a very surprised offer given by my teacher came up to me: Organizing a volunteer training class. Of course, I accepted that as one of my assignments but I could not imagine how lucky I was right after saying &quot;yes&quot; to her and I earned many things from that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the job was about helping some professionals from Malaysia plan and implement a training class for some volunteers who would be selected from students in my university in order to prepare for a cancer preventing project. Chatting with foreigners was not a big deal with me but discussing something in professional with them, beat me!. I had never thought about that till then. There is a fact that in hard situation, people seems to be more intelligent, actually, more hard working. Thanks to that, I was motivated to force myself to spending hours on listening and watching professional conversations which might help me look more professional working with the partners from Malaysia, which had rarely happened since I was born. Ironically, most of what I really gained was not from those formal videos. It is listening to conversation between my teacher and the professionals which help me really learn about how to make serious conversation. Not only did I improve my English skill but I also grew up in aspect of professional working, especially negotiation. There must be no soft skill class can teach me as such this real situation. My English skill also improved thanks to some minor works such as translating documents, interpretating and so forth. Obviously, through this event, I had a protential chance to push my English to a higher level. In fact, I took that successfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the problem that I had to take out some proper students in my university because there was only limit number of participants allowed in the class whereas so many students had registered to participate. An interview sounded good for solving this problem. In some point of view, that was really a good course to become an interviewer. However, never had I made an interview. Fortunately, I accidentally had a predecessor helped me out. He seemed to be quite experienced on this aspect. In fact, I learnt a lot from him. He taught me how to judge people and know who is the approriate one, just through their looks, and giving some suitable questions to them. With him, making question was very important and like an art. Interestingly, I gained a wonderful idea from him that is &quot;The best thing you have may not be what I need&quot;, which meant an interviewee need to satisfy what the interviewer need, not just showing off the best he has. It would be essential for me in the future when I look for jobs after graduation. I didn&apos;t think that I would gain such a good experience in this event. So surprised!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third I got was apparently changed my style. It was not about my fashion or my look, it was about my attitude when standing in front of people. Due to some breakdown, I was pushed into an unexpected situation in which, I played as a role of MC during the time of the class. Honestly, I was not good at giving speech, especially to many people in such a formal event like this. However, I was encouraged so much by my friends and my teacher. I also bravely, I can say, try to make something different with hoping there would not be any embarrassment. I spent much time on reading book, surfing internet, asking people about giving speech. I really did everything possible to prevent the worst thing might happen. Funnily, those things that I planned to prevent did not happen, but I couldn&apos;t expect there were other embarrassing scenes, such as forgeting what to say next, lacking information of professionals or even their names... All of them drove me stressed and feel under pressure. However, in reverse, I acquired lots of experience for myself. I knew that I need to prepare much more, take note everything possible during the time and be always flexible to unexpected situations during the programme and so on... Afterward, though I was not successful in this role of MC, I still truely found more confident and even wanted to make some more, which I had never thought about beforehand. It was not only a change in my style but it was also a bright sign in my career. I really appreciated what I had gained up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font size=\"4\">Anyway, according to my teachers and some professionals, the class was organized successfully. Although I know that was only encouragement, I have been still proud of that. Surprisingly, the benefit I earned from the event was not money (In fact, there was no &quot;money&quot; in my word) but it was about those precious lessons of professional working. Now, the last lesson is that money is not the best benefit.</font>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\r\n\t\t"
