I don&apos;t think you can improve your overall skills. I suggest you to focus on studying more about writing and reading skills first. For instance, &quot;I&apos;m studying in 12. With 6 months, from today to June, what can I do, help me&quot; - I don&apos;t really understand your sentences here. I think it&apos;s supposed to be &quot;I&apos;m in 12th grade. Within 6 months from now, what can I do, any suggestion will be very much appreciated&quot;. Try to work on simple stuff like this and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be fine. <br>\r\nEnglish test in VN is a freaking joke. I remember back in the day when I was hated for busting my Viet-Eng teacher lol <img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->You need to restructure your sentence first if you want to survive in upcoming test. The basic thing that you should do now is read your textbook again. I believe that there is a lot of interesting thing to learn in there <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
