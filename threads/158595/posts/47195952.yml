  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tHi everyone. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/byebye.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Byebye\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\nJust posted this on F17 but it seems nobody is interested in it. I want to introduce to you a very popular TV series in the UK: the apprentice. This series is for people who wants to start their own busisnesses because it provides a lot of business experience, business principles and how to apply them to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe series is about a rich old man named Sugar looking for a business partner to invest his 250,000 pounds. There are 16 candidates and they have to compete with each other. Each week, the candidates are divided into two teams and do the same task. <br>\r\nThe task could be selling second hand stuffs, selling street food or designing a marketing campaign. In the losing team, the leader of the team (for that week) has to bring him/herself and two others that he/she doesn&apos;t like to the bottom three, where Mr Sugar will decide who is the worst candidate and deserved to be fired (being sent home). This is the funniest part of the show since these three guys try to blame others for the failure of the task. One week, one candidate goes home until the last person remains and wins the competition. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/too_sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Too Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a very useful series I think because it can help you not only with business English but also business itself. You will know how people here are doing business and you can learn from them, applying to your own business.<br>\r\nAlso, there is a very funny show named You&apos;re fired on BBC. It comments the show with some hilarious people including the person just being fired. It is very very funny <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two ways to watch this series: by Youtube or BBC iplayer. I&apos;m not sure you can use BBC Iplayer in Vietnam (may be you have to use fake proxy) but it has Eng sub and better for you if you are not confident in listening to English.<br>\r\nyoutube.com/watch?v=ijg-nrMjh3o<br>\r\nIf anyone wants to discuss or share something about the series don&apos;t hesitate to comment here or talk to me at ken_ukman (YM)<br>\r\nHope you have fun <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
