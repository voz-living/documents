It is also used in constructions like \"diplomatic relations\" or \"international relations.\"  When relations is used of specific people, it is a very formal use that refers to the act of sexual intercourse.  It is NOT correct to say, \"I am in relations with him.\"  For that, you would use the word relationship.\r\nRelationship tends to be used more broadly and generally to describe the interactions between specific people or smaller groups of people.
