    I've not watched it yet. But my friends watched it and they almost said they
    felt a bit disapointed at this episode, it looked so different from the
    trailer, Ultron was so weak and talkative, all of the scenes only have the
    highlight when Hulk fight with the Hulkbuster, and now they are looking
    forward to the next: "Civil war" that may be much better. 

    But anyway I still want to enjoy this ep
