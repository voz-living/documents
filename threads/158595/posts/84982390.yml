It&apos;s hard to catch up at the first time. My English is enough for daily life. I can&apos;t still discuss or talk hour by hour with Singaporean. My boss said that accent isn&apos;t important rather than fluency. I don&apos;t think so. Sweet pronounce is easier to understand. Do you prefer native speaker to non native speaker? I think all of us always prefer native speaker. And Singaporean and any one are too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some accents in English. If you think that a guy mispronounced, you should find what accent the guys speak, not correct them. Some guys speak US English, and some other do UK English, and Australia English, and some mix these kinds.\r\n\t\t"
