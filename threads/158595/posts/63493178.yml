  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOK guys, in my opinion, your ex-girlfriend should be completely in the past mode... I used to have my beautiful one, the same age with me. We had many memories that I would never forget. When we broke up, she recommended that we could be close friends forever to share everything in our life; I however refused. Do you know why? Because when we have a chance to talk or to meet each other (just two of us), our memories are back! I am afraid that I cannot control myself and my feelings, which can damage my family... My first love is for her, I will never regret about that. But our destinies are just feel like a dream...\r\n\t\t"
