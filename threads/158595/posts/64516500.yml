    Maybe you are right. We must wait or I will wait till the final film:
    "Hobbit: there and back again". By the way, when I went to Megastar Hung
    Vuong to watch "Gravity", the ticket costed me 75,000VND (60,000 VND for the
    promotion plus 15,000VND for Dolby Atmos). I think "Doraemon" will be the
    last movie which I watch in this year.
