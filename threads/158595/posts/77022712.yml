It may calm you down, make you feel better but it won&apos;t wash the weight from your shoulders. But when you talk to someone you know(friends, family or acquaintances perhap), you feel like you&apos;re exposing your true self - a vulnerable person.

I kept everything that happened to me from my family. I went online, told the strangers I met about my problems. Of course I got some advice but they were bullsh*t. I could tell those things to myself. I thought those advice were what I needed but it wasn&apos;t. I dealt with my problems all by myself.

Let me quote exactly what my old man said to me. &quot;It is all about trust, son.
