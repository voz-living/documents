This&apos;s just some trashy words ha ha! <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\nLunar new year festival is coming in our country. There are only 2 weeks more but i have already felt new year atmosphere at everywhere. In those day, staffs at my firm just go to work in order to check id. All most dont have spirit to work, so me too. All of day , i just sit around and using internet. In the end of year, we are expecting about holidays and bonuses from company. I would have also recieved my first salary. I intend i will buy somethings for my folks. Because my family is small, with 3 people include my parents and me. So i think according to the budget which we shall be gotten in this year then we can have comfortable conditions to celebrate this special event. Its so amazing when i have known we could have over 10 days for the holiday. I will spend all of those days to stay at home with my parents due to i have lived far away from them in a long time. I personally feel so lucky cause my hometown is immensely near HCM city . So that, its easy to go home and take a ticket bus as well. Whereas others found its extremly hard to possess a ticket bus which will take them to their hometown. Yeah in fact, there were so many waiters at bus station in HCM city where i am living.<br>\r\nHey vozers , how are you today and DO you all have any plan for this lunar new year ?\r\n\t\t"
