I personally think it&apos;s so terrible and put on the alert.This one really made me feel confusing and daunting a bit while i&apos;m in my last year.So far what i knew, there are 2 main reason which might lead this result.First of all, this&apos;s attitude learning of Vietnam&apos;s student.Most of them just spend their free time for play game,using facebook and smartphone...<br>\r\nFurther and more important thing is they&apos;ve told that they do not have any goal life as well as unknown orientation &apos;bout their future.Secondly, this error also belong to university curriculum which have been critised from society.But we have also to consider about career skills that was seriously weakness of students.<br>\r\nThese skills comprise foreign languages, team work, communication, major skills...and so on.In conclusion,i wanna tell to vozers and especially F17ers that we&apos;re leading generation of our country, so that we need to change our thinking in order to help Viet Nam become an thrive and beautiful country as dream of respected Ho Chi Minh president.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave a good day to you guys <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
