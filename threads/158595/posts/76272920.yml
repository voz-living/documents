Its not acceptable for a professional developer as my leader said to me. I just wanna give up and forget everything else behind me and take a long trip in next month.In fact, i have no idea about where i will go but it will be a romote place where no one could find out me. Hopefully, after that trip i could figure out what is suitable with me.May be, i am not belong to this city...Everynight in my dreams, i saw my dream came true, that my ex came back to me and i could say to her that how much i love and miss her since the day she walk away from me.Sometime, i asked myself that who i am and what is my passionate field? As the result, in order to gain clear understanding of this meaning life i would like to go as far as possible and get to know something new by observation of different things around me.Omg...at 22 years old...i am fearing about my future...\r\n\t\t"
