She works 7 days per week from early morning to evening, then she teaches English for some students right after she leaves her company... According to her schedule, she really doesn&apos;t have time for chatting with me when she is at work, and even when she gets home, that couldn&apos;t be better anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said that she rarely chats on facebook, and only use Skype for talking, then she suggest me installing skype and starting using it to talk with her so that we can practice English together. But with her schedule, i wonder how hard this relation is since she really doesn&apos;t have time for hanging out with her friends and me as well... Should i continue this ?\r\n\t\t"
