I don&#x2019;t feel like doing any non-Moore-related work). While I was yawning (so much that my jaws hurt like hell), it kinda struck me: Let&#x2019;s make a blog, again. It&#x2019;s been quite a while since I wrote something, and I miss writing. It&#x2019;s hard to find someone who listens, and I really need something to dump my thoughts, especially when so many things are going on at the same time like this. Me blog, now you&#x2019;re me homie! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing in my mind, I&#x2019;m sleepy. SLEEPY, like capital SLEEPY in capital letters. Woke up today at 5, studied till 7.30, went to immigration dep to renew pama&#x2019;s passports (which were refused to be renewed after my 1 hour waiting in line), went to class, went to lunch, went to Moore. I have a pang of despair thinking about the long hot dusty ride home with countless of jams I am going to encounter later. After that, I think even one whole pack of beedies and a gallon of redbull won&#x2019;t keep me awake. But the talk with my bro will. He&#x2019;s probably pissed off right now cos I didn&#x2019;t update my online schedule, and probably will scream his ass off later when I told him it is because I fell asleep last night after 2 beers with my boss. Something has gone wrong there. My alcohol capacity has gone up, but beer capacity - down all the way. Boss, next time just nuts and beedies for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about beedies, I&#x2019;m running out of them soon. Should I ship some beedies from Mangalore here? No not some. Since more and more people are falling in love with them, I think I better ship a few cartons and start whole-saling!! What, Rs 7 for a pack, I should sell one for 50k here. That&#x2019;s 1200% profit! I see big money. Anyone wanna invest?! Damn, if that&#x2019;s the case, screw college. I can just sell beedies and open my own chai wallah. Then Masala Chinky Beedie N&#x2019; Chai Corporation! I think this is becoming my dream. Yah mon, Beedie N&#x2019; Chai - the way, the truth, and the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould leave office now, beedie&#x2019;s crying out for me..\r\n\t\t"
