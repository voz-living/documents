Such reflection could only be trained by daily practices. Unfortunately, we do not have such environment in Vietnam. Therefore sitcoms is a possible remedy. The setting of the film are usually the familiar places such as bar or around the television, where people discuss about current affairs or have simple daily chit chatting. This is what will be very similar to when we communicate with foreigners. Secondly, sitcoms are series-movies that have the same actors and actress with the same accent for every episode.
