There is a fact that the more languages you learn, the more you realize how easy English is. I&apos;m not being subjective, because there are lots of evidence showing that. English as an international language has simplified and discarded many of its original grammatical characteristics over time, due to the effect of globalization. There is only one gender of noun, as compared to 2 in French and 3 in German. Some are even attested with up to 20. For those who don&apos;t know, it means that besides each noun, which you only have to remember its pronunciation and meaning in English, in other languages you have to remember its gender in addtion. &quot;The cat&quot; is not enough, but &quot;The girl cat&quot; for example. Not to mention these genders are purely grammatical and not really relevant to the actual gender of the object, which is really a headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, English syntax is firm and relies much on word order, or S-V-O particularly. For this reason there are only one 2 cases in English, subject and object, as marked by he, she, we and him, her, us for instance. Along with a fairly amount of verb tenses as oppossed to French and a limited amount of irregular verbs. English has a minimal inflection compared with other Indo-European languages. Some small trade-offs I find are the inconsistency of spelling, though still better than Chinese, and an enormous vocabulary, probably the largest according to some estimations.
