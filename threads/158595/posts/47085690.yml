I got it, dude. But &quot;practice perfect make perfect&quot;. I know some people say that you don&apos;t have to focus on grammar so much.

And for others like me, this is just the place to have fun. So, just chill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd don&apos;t make me wrong, I&apos;d also like to see people using correct grammar when they speak. But again, you cannot expect so much from a beginner. We were all beginners once; and even though we can speak well right now doesn&apos;t mean we should be harsh when seeing other beginners making mistakes. As a child learn how to speak, he may use wrong grammar or has bad pronunciation; however, we all should encourage him to talk more, not to find all the mistakes and then throw them at his face. It&apos;s maybe a bad analogy; but I think you get my point. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
