  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tMany people say that VOA program is boring and too slow, but it is useful for correcting your pronunciation. After you feel that you can pronunce well, accurately, then try some other listening programs or exercises, such as Longman. It&apos;s quite easy, and the speed is faster than VOA just a little bit. There you can feel more confident with listening skill, so continue with higher level books like Delta key, Barron, Cambridge.... Beside, you should listen  to radio, TV shows, films, in order to practicing with the way and the speed that English people speak. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
