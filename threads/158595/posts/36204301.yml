However, I&apos;ll give it a try. Firstly, I&apos;ll pick the word &quot;open-minded&quot;. Normally, people afraid to try new things. But how can they know how it would be if they even haven&apos;t tried it. In my opinion, new experiences always make me fell so excited. The second word chosen is &quot;patient&quot;. Sometimes people give up immediately after a first few attempts. However, there&apos;s many works in daily life need a patience, for instance, studying English, so I think we just keep going, put more efforts and finally we&apos;ll succeed. The last word that can be used to describe myself is &quot;friendly&quot;. I am willing to help other people if I can. Plus, I am also interested in making new friends. So I wanna say &apos;hi&apos; to everyone in this topic and welcome all of your comments on my writing <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
