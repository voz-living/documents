It makes complete sense to me, to you, to many but not all of us. Those are people who spend without consideration; thus, have crossed the line and had their butt hole stuffed with bigger shit that it&apos;s already been. You could blame them for their own stupidity. But it&apos;s also because the system allowed them to do so. An easy and effortless credit-granting system enables people to get what they might think they deserve, which in fact they do not. People tend to spend more than what they earn, and that&apos;s where the problem kicks in.
