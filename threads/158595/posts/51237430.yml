In the much simple way, we should define the tense which is used in the sentence, then decide the proper tense for verb. IMO, in this case, the word &quot;conduct&quot; is used as a verb because in the sentence, it showed the research was done by another subject (who we considered the reseachers), not by its self. Therefore, passive voice was used as showing actions done by another subjects, and the past participle was a pure verb.</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->well your explain didn&apos;t work for me <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/pudency.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Pudency\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nmaybe explain though english lead the sitiuation to the harder way <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/pudency.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Pudency\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
