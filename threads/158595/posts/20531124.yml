I came across this question during my study:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark the letter A, B, C or D on your answers sheet to indicate the sentence that is closest in meaning to each of of the following question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n &quot;You did a great job. I&apos;m proud of your achievement. &quot; said the woman to her grandchild<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. The woman said that her grandchild&apos;s job was great and she was proud of his work.<br>\r\nB. The woman told her grandchild that she was proud of his achievement at work.<br>\r\nC. The woman told her grandchild to do a great job so that she could be proud of his work.<br>\r\nD. The woman complimented her grandchild on his achievement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer given was B. But i think that &quot;did a great job&quot; could be referred to anything, not only something at work. Therefor, the correct answer should be D. It&apos;s been bugging me, what do you think about it?\r\n\t\t"
