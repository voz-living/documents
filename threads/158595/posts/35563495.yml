    A bad day today is almost over. I've have a terrible day with an evil
    teacher. He asked me to learn a lot without a rest. I felt seriously and
    wanted to call him a bastard or some bad words like that. I hate him alot
    and want to give up studying right now. What is going on in my mind?. So I
    am writing here to reduce my bad feeling. Also, I would like someone to
    check the grammar mistakes in all my writtings. Thanks so much.
