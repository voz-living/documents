According to your comments, I would see that you still did not get what I&apos;d meant. Just forget it, we&apos;re back to your problems now: Will you need to do a toeic test soon? If &quot;yes&quot;, I think it&apos;s better if you find a class out there. Learning by yourself could take more time. If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then its fine, just do it step by step. You cant have a nice house without a firm foundation.
