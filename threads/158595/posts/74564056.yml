    No! Exactly to say I have ever never been a part of it.  i don't want to
    confess that.  i really hate that.  but i know it's not your fault. Just
    because I fooled myself with stupid thoughts that maybe I could be with you
    as long as i tried.  i hate this feeling, too. I can't show ppl my broken
    heart. I have to stay normal as usual in my life. My beloved ppl scrificed a
    lots for me  they deserve everything rather than hurt again.  but I feel so
    sad  every night it kills me from inside. I really want you here.  if only i
    could hug you now
