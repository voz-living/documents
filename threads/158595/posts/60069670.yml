To be honestly at first, I was born in 1996, and this is my real story. Anyone who told me to shut down the computer and go studying would lose my respect in a jiff.

My problem isn&apos;t all about the possibility of going to college, Actually i&apos;m pretty confident in my capability as I has plunged into studying since the begining of summer. But I cannot give 100 percent of my concentration because my mind has been occupied by this thing: I have a gf, We&apos;ve been together for nearly 2 years. Recently i&apos;ve read lots of thread about our fellow Vozer who had problem with their gf, some even broke up after years of relationship, which killed all my faith in the relationships <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\">. It now seems to be extremely fragile althought it&apos;s actually still going fine. A lot of my friends admit they couldn&apos;t maintain their relationship in the last year of high school. Some of them even told me to proactively put and end to the relationship, I&apos;ve been thinking about that, I mean... Why trying to maintain something that you don&apos;t even know when it&apos;s gonna end? But the point is... In the otherhand, I cannot let go the relationship raised for such a long time <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/too_sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Too Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone here ever had a long-term relationship that succeeded?<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sexy_girl.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sexy Girl\" class=\"inlineimg\"> Should I carry on with my every small piece of hope?
