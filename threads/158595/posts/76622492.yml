    I'm being dead serious here. Is it possible to suddenly feel dumb? Two days
    ago, I felt like a fucking genius, I was interested in stuff like
    philosophies and Sigmund Freud. I even had an existential crisis at a very
    young age. Suddenly after communicating with stupid people in my native
    language, I feel dumber. You know that 'I'm slowly becoming one of them'
    feeling? It's there. I can feel it. WHY?
