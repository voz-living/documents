Having someone to correct every sentences you write in this thread will not help much. Don&apos;t underestimate what you learn in high school; their teaching does lack of listening, speaking,reading and somewhat writing. But they do a pretty good job on grammar. So, don&apos;t slack off in class, pay attention during the lecture, do your homework, work up with your grammar, and you will be just fine. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOriginally Posted by <strong>monkey+Heo2</strong>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"showthread.php?p=47109782#post47109782\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"images/buttons/viewpost.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"View Post\"></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"font-style:italic\">You are right, dude!
