And now, I&apos;m trying to get more post as fast as possible. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sexy_girl.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sexy Girl\" class=\"inlineimg\"> I named it The New Beginning because i thought it would be a good nickname to remind myself of this fucking time. Life is tough. So, sometimes you have to make a new start to refresh something in your life.  <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/go.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Go\" class=\"inlineimg\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnw, if I made any mistakes in my grammar, plzz correct me. Thanks!\r\n\t\t"
