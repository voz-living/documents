There are two kinds of vocabulary : receptive and active. Receptive vocabulary is words you know but don&apos;t use it.

For instance I know the word egalitarianism and get the meaning of it when reading, but I don&apos;t often use it when writting or speaking, but use circumlocution instead. Receptive vocabulary is usually larger than the active one. Reading only helps one&apos;s receptive vocabulary enlarge.
