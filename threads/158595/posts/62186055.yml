    I don't know where the problem comes from but I can't access to the
    internet. That's why I have to move from my desk to my bed 

    after a writing class today, I find that I have forgot a lot of things I
    have learnt  I haven't written an academic essay for a long time, that put
    me in a hard situation when I have to write with a time limit 


    feel really upset with myself -.-
