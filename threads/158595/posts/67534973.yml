    idk wth is this but whatever 

    You said you love me
    I was so happy
    But now, I'm lonely
    In empty darkness

    My life is a mess
    I'm useless, I know
    So, I let you go
    The sorrow is dead

    I will go to bed
    The sadness fade out
    I will dream about
    Knockout the sad love
