    Have anybody read "The Alchemist" of Paulo Coelho, I'm currently reading
    this book and I found that this is a very meaningful book, It tells a story
    about a boy who had dreamed the same dream two times, in that dream someone
    tells him that he can find a hidden treasure nearby an egyp pyramid. At
    first, he didn't believe it, but then he met with some mysterious people who
    told him that he should go to egyp to find the treasure and he decided to
    to. He had faced so many challenges and difficulties during the journey.
    Sometimes he wanted to give up the dream but then his desire still pushed
    him forwards. Finally, with the help of the alchemist (a person who can turn
    lead into gold) he found the treasure, but the treasure was found not near
    the pyramid but at the abandoned church where the boy had that dream (it
    means the boy have to come back to where he began the journey, where he had
    slept and dreamed of the treasure to find the treasure). What I have learned
    from this book is that we must find out what is our dream, our desire and
    have the courage to do whatever it takes to achieve it. There is a saying
    that I really like in this book: "when you want something, all the universe
    conspires in helping you to achieve it".
