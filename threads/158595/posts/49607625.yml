    Cycling is great and all but cycling in Vietnam is troublesome. When it's
    hot, you sweat like there's no tomorrow; when it rains, you say hello to
    mud. Guess what? There aren't that many building equipped with shower rooms
    either, so you'll be most likely a hygienic disaster for your surrounding.
    Besides, the infrastructure in Vietnamese big cities is hideous and hampers
    cyclists' speed considerably. That's why you see a lot less of mountain and
    racing bicycles than city bicycles.
