    I have a big question. What do you do when there are too many things you
    have to deal with and you come under too much pressure? At this time, I am
    preparing for a important IELTS test at this September while finding the way
    to earn money to cover the ielts course fee and costs of living. I always
    have trouble in the office because my job is so boring and have no future
    (but it gives me a moderate salary).


    I also have to find another room to rent because the current is leaked (I
    moved house 4 times in last 2 years).


    My grandmother has broken her arm last month, while my parents need my help
    to resolve an argument they got into with my elder brother (I don't live and
    work in my hometown with my family).


    One more thing, tonight my girlfriend has asked me that we should not keep
    contact in some time because she want thinks carefully and seriously about
    our relationship


    Yes, life is fucking me.
