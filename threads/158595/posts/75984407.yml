    i went to school yesterday,i got there quite early so i sat down at the
    chair, when i stood up my head hit the roof of the elevator and my head got
    really hurt and swollen, i could not stand anymore so i went to the store
    and bought some salts and rub it on my head and now i felt  a little bit
    better than yesterday.
