There are two kinds of vocabulary : receptive and active. Receptive vocabulary is words you know but don&apos;t use it. Active vocabulary is words you know and are able to use it fluently when speaking or writting. For instance I know the word egalitarianism and get the meaning of it when reading, but I don&apos;t often use it when writting or speaking, but use circumlocution instead. Receptive vocabulary is usually larger than the active one. Reading only helps one&apos;s receptive vocabulary enlarge. To make it get into your receptive vocabulary, the only way is to try to use it as soon as you have learned it. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->thank bros, I&apos;m trying to watch movie with english subtitle, improve the vocabulary and listening skills.
