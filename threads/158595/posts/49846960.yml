The most important thing is that you can catch the keywords( I mean the new words and important words) in that page and you can understand what it wanna deliver. Besides, you don&apos;t need to learn by heart at once all the new words, just separate them into period of time, maybe a few times per day. Furthermore, look the words up in dictionary to have accurate pronunciation. Good luck^^</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I&apos;m very very very agree with u bro <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sure.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sure\" class=\"inlineimg\">. Because Vietnamese vocabulary is not large, so in many times, you can&apos;t translate perfect a passage to Vietnamese. Instead, you should understand what it means. With that, you can understand many new words but <u>not</u> need to know what it means in Vietnamese <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/shame.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Shame\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
