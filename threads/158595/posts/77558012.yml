This means I will able to be an official software engineer since this moment. Such a beautiful thing ever! <br>\r\nIn fact, I have not finished my curriculum at university yet, i mean im just a last year student now! But there is a small unlucky thing happened to me. I still have some remain major subjects at shool.So that, i found it so confusing and complex. Maybe , i will need to shut down my study at shool for working and finish final thesis at the night also. Hopefully, It would be a precise decision to me... <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
