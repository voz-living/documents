I hate your suck english that by the book.<br>\r\nOnly stupiest guy think that those words i make come out from a translator program. I learn English from movies, and don&apos;t care about some grammar. I can talk more formally but i don&apos;t like it, i hate english that by the book, it&apos;s not what  people talk everyday. You know, the word &quot;fuck&quot; that people in some country  speaking English it&apos;s not real fuck like &quot;mother fuck&quot; as some vietnames think. I come to the office, i some time hear my boss say &quot;you fuck me huh?&quot; i think there some thing wrong with this guy, but then he explain to me. It&apos;s that when you did something wrong to someone, then it mean you fuck them. Some time i got my email from a partner in Singapore, they&apos;re very good at english, but still have some certain mistake in their email, they know it but don&apos;t care. what they speak or write is always short, easy understand, and bring full of their idea, inclue their emotion. You know some speaking in vietnames like &quot;fe^ loi`&quot;, something like that, very intersting and is what people likely to use in everyday life. So stupid guy like you may have that stupid thought (i just more prefer use &quot;that damn thought&quot;). Come and spend the rest of your life to find out that fucking translator. I wish you could, lol. My word i know have many mistake but i don&apos;t care, it&apos;s just my nature english, not by any book. A lot of english word that i use, i understand it and don&apos;t care what it is translated in vietnamese.<br>\r\n Many people speaking english come from singapore, bangladesh, india (i may mistake with those names, don&apos;t care), their english is really hard to understand, someone like the worker, they speak <br>\r\nfluenty, very fast, and good listening, but they only use a few way of speaking, it repeat with a little word like : have, have not, coming, .., these words mostly show up on their speaking. These are enough for work, and i don&apos;t make fun out of that . So you jay with your little head, your little knowledge don&apos;t mess me with some stupid coment like that, you noob.\r\n\t\t"
