    The happiest I've been is probably when I was still in primary school. From
    then on I got more and more misery, as future worries and repetitions
    increased. The most disturbing part is when I realized that I wasn't really
    anything special, and would die some day without leaving anything
    substantial behind. It goes without saying but that's also the life of many
    people in the world.
