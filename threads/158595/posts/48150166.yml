The reason you see many people having hard time getting a job atm is due to the economic recession. However, I believe things would get better for next couple years.

It will eventually get better overtime as long as you keep living in US. I used to have the same problem when I first went US, but after a year or so as I became a high school freshman, I were able to communicate pretty well with others, thank to all my friends in middle school. So, practice, practice, more practice; and you will be good. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/nosebleed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nose Bleedding\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/nosebleed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nose Bleedding\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/nosebleed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nose Bleedding\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
