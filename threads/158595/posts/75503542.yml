I&apos;ll never forget those days, you know i have to spend all day for a simple email which to say in reply. But i am now ready to use english in any situations. Of course, sometime i have to struggle for listening or writing with a complex form or the one with academic content. But however, i&apos;ve already <b><font size=\"4\">found down</font></b> that&apos;s i have been progressing so much! So that, i truly wanna share my method what helped me improve my english skill. First of all, you need to determine the meaning of english learning and get the passion . I mean you need to focus on what kind of english you really need to learn. Then i high recommend you an english youtube channel.( Let chooses the field which you like, i usually listen to news from TED but if you&apos;re just newbie, i think VOA special english is greatly suitable for you). You should spend 30&apos; per day in order to practise listening with that channel. In term of reading, you could choose an english news website to practise reading skills. I am using english.vietnamnet.vn. Is it amazing when you could both practise english skills and get to know news. Lastly, the english hardest skill is writing. Hmm you can use this thread to improve your writing by your comments and others will correct errors for you or you could try to write diary like me ha ha. It could be interested in writing than normal methods. In conclusion, no work hard - no success , my friend . Nothing&apos;s impossible when you&apos;ve handled a reasonable method and high spirit. Keep it going and you&apos;ll get your result!
