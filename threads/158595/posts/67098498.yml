  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI can&apos;t understand why this fucking weather has lasted too long this year. In the winter i wished it would have been spring. When the spring came with &quot;n&#x1ED3;m&quot; i wished it would have been summer. Today i thought it was summer with drier weather so I opened the door, and I just have to clean the floor because of wet and dirty floor. When does the &quot;n&#x1ED3;m&quot; weather end? <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/canny.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Canny\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBtw, i will have an English exam for the graduation in May. This year, according to the Ministry of Education, the exam will have a writing test. So i hope you all help me in writing skill and correct my faults by quoting and correct them with red color. Thank you very much <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sweet_kiss.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sweet Kiss\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
