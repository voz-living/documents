    I randomly found this passage on google. And that's how I'm feeling now.


    "Some people are just born to annoy me. I wish not to deal with them. I wish
    not to see them. To be honest, i really wish them to vanish. That’s bad but
    it’s just a wish, in real life i have to smile n talk with them. But it’s
    grrrrr.grrrrr."
