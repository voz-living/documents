    My study major is Information Technology. I'm currently looking for a new
    job. Before that, I have worked in IT field for 1 years. But probably, I
    don't really like this job, especially my major. I'm feel worried about
    looking for a new job because I'm not sure about my ability and experience.
    So could you guys give me some advices?
