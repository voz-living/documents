At that time, She was dating with a boy and kicked his ass right away. I'm 25 years old (same her), don't want to have a relationship with other girl because I want to focus on my career. We talked together many times and she said she might marry me when she was 30 years old .\r\nI can't find anyone better than her and I can't (?) take much time to find a new girl, so is thereany hope for me?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\nI will add my fix here based on run aweyyyyy's version, though there are still some problems i've not mentioned here.\r\nSome of your sentences can cause misunderstanding to readers, or they aren't related to the other phrase.\r\nEg: \r\nI live without money from my family until 2nd grade in university, and now I'm graduated, and haven't a job.\r\n-> So you somehow stayed alive before 2nd year of university without the money from your family?
