The link I gave you is just a mini-test, which can only grade your reading and listening skills. In fact,in the real Toefl, there would be human-being examiners listening to your speech and checking your writing.In addition, speaking section is a combination of independent speaking and integrated one, which requires you to speak after you listen and read about a topic.It is similar with the writing section in Toefl.That is why I suppose Toefl is tough(for me).If you don&apos;t think so,it&apos;s up to you.
