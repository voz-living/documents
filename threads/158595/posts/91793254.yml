I told them a thousand times that english doesn&apos;t always translate. There&apos;re words that have multiple meanings and can be used as different parts of speech. For example, when i taught phrases like get-line which means xep&apos; hang`, they got hella confused. One gentlemen actually thought &quot;fold&quot; and &quot;get&quot; had the same meaning, cuz you know they all &quot;xep&quot; LOL. He actually used it the next writing about how how much he hates xep do` and do chores.\r\n\t\t"

    thing that drove me crazy was they always tried to connect an english word
    to a vietnamese one. I told them a thousand times that english doesn't
    always translate. There're words that have multiple meanings and can be used
    as different parts of speech. For example, when i taught phrases like
    get-line which means xep' hang`, they got hella confused. One gentlemen
    actually thought "fold" and "get" had the same meaning, cuz you know they
    all "xep" LOL. He actually used it the next writing about how how much he
    hates xep do` and do chores.
