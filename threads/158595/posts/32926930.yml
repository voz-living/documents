    An Oz couple coming to Saigon next week asked me to write down some
    interesting places  to eat for them. It's so fking hard, especially for
    foreign people due to the sanitary issue, cause they want to try vietnamese
    cuisine, such as: 'pha lau', 'bun rieu'. Begin to lose my sanity. Any idea
    guys?
