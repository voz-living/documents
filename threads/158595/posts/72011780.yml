  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI miss my parents, my younger brother. I want to come back my hometown but I have only 3 free days. Maybe I decide to stay because I want to continue part-time job to earn money for tuition. My younger brother asked me if I had lover and I said &quot;No&quot;but he doesn&apos;t believe me. He thinks that because of my lover, I don&apos;t come back hometown. He doesn&apos;t know that actually, I don&apos;t have time to love anyone, moreover noone loves me. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sure.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sure\" class=\"inlineimg\">. <br>\r\nNext 2 weeks, maybe I will have a new job, I will be busier. I can not talk to anyone about this job in particular my father. He will not allow me to do, he wants me to focus on studying. I understand what he does but I still decide to do without saying anything to him. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/go.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Go\" class=\"inlineimg\"> .\r\n\t\t"
