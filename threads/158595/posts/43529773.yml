  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTalking about Microsoft office, I bought a Dell laptop 2 months ago, and it has Office 2010 pre-installed. It requires me to purchase a product key. I tried to look for a key online (well, I&apos;m still Vietnamese you know <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\">), but when I put the product key in, it is only the trial version. Is there anyway to get a full version of Office with only a product key? <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/embarrassed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Embarrassed\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\nOtherwise I will have to download it and use crack <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/pudency.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Pudency\" class=\"inlineimg\">.\r\n\t\t"
