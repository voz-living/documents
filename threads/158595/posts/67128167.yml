How can i overcome this moment when everything seems to be boring. My family is too far from me. They have a special part in my heart, i love them so much. However, it is so unfair that i can&apos;t choose where to work, to live a comfortable life. Sometimes, i find myself in trouble to make a decision. It is said that &quot;Decide not to decide is a decision, fail to decide is a failure. I must confess that i am a bad failure. A lot of things interrupt this little mind, they are like the sharp knives that cut my heart into small pieces, so hurt.  The job i am doing here, the active environment i am living in, the people i meet and especially, the one i love all change my thoughts so much. I love staying here and do anything i wanna do, i get used to the sudden rain in a sunny day. However, all my love is just for my family in the hometown. Mum, you must be so disappointed in me. I wish i could turn back the hands of the time so that i don&apos;t know anything here. Trust me, i am just working on it, i will try best for you.
