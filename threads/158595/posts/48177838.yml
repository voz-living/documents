I think this is the right place for this.<br>\r\nI&apos;m in need of some guys that can work along with me in translating movies into Vietnamese for dubbing (no need of timing, so software skills requirements is zero).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe would have to submit the finished dub a few hours after a decent release is out (DVDScr or R5 or better) so we would have to start working with the movies before that, with the help of those CAM, TS, Screener releases, the Eng subs, Arab subs, Indo subs, Google translate... and most importantly your listening skill, or your &quot;make-it-up&quot; skill lol, and be done with the easy parts of the movies, then when a decent release with a decent English sub is out, we could just finish the job in a few hours. So you would have a few months of preparing for a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the release is out with an English sub, they would pay <b><font color=\"Red\">200k</font></b> for a movie. If not, it would be <font color=\"Red\"><b>300k</b></font> since the work would be a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be best if you live in <font color=\"Red\"><b>HCM city</b></font>.
