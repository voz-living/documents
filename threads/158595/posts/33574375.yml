As i understand, you should just say something like this: I&apos;m afraid because my English is not so good. Or If you insist on keeping your sentence, then it should be corrected like this: I am afraid because I speak English very badly. But then, doesn&apos;t it sound a bit...weird?

It should be corrected like this: I&apos;m not interested in your opinion/s. It&apos;s grammatically right that way, but again, it sounds a little odd/obscure to me (personally of course, others can understand your point just fine).
