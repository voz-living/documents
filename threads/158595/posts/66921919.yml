This is not limited to only try to land a job, but more importantly try to reach your dream jobs which you enjoy being with. I think this period of time may also help you a lot to try and improve yourself. Always try to balance between your life and work, since I myself had made such a mistake when I devoted all my time to works and neglect all my friends and the wonderful world out there.

My only piece of advice for you is to keep calm, try your best, never lose faith in yourself and certainly you will succeed even in this industry.
