    <part of my exam>

    Q:tell me about your impression at this course(Money and banking). Feel free
    to express your thinking and giving advice(15 point)

    A: (1st choice)

    Dear Mr. HuFengYun

    It's sad to tell you that i'm not gonna pass this time. Frankly, that's not
    because of my intellect or my laziness, it's all your fault. It's hard to
    learn Chinese, but that's not the point. The point is, your english is very
    very disgusting thing that i can't understand what you'd said. Sad but true,
    your english skill is nowhere near my skill, and even that, your teaching
    skill is suck! even the most horrible teacher that i've met in the couple of
    years ago could't even make me feel that sleepy.

    save all the best for the last: thank you for giving me this 15 points for
    free. hope that you could find your self a pistol and fire at your head.

    (2nd Choice)

    Dear Mr.HuFengYun

    I feel that your course is rather interesting than most of the others. It's
    sad to tell you that i'm not gonna pass this time even that i kinda like it
    becaus there's some part of it i can't keep up.

    First thing come first, the main problems is my laziness, i don't blame any
    of the other problem that i listed below

    second one is the most pity part: your course is full of wonderful
    collections of basic knowledge about moneytary, fund, banking... but it's
    very hard to find out that what is the book of choice for this course

    the third is my own problem again. It's the language problem, i can't
    understand and maybe misunderstand most of your analysis in the class. It's
    the main problem of the the last team-homework.

    Your teaching skill is incredible, made the student feel free to express
    themselves, made their innovative harmony in the form of team work.It's
    marvelous, it's the dawn of new teaching tek-nik, second-to-none

    Best regards
