We had a small business in Hanoi for a week, not so much time but it was enough for both of us to get some interesting experience. Our plane landed at NoiBai airport in the early morning. After some checked in procedure at the airport, we went outside and started our trip. The airport is located 28 miles from the city&apos;s downtown so we must to find a cab or bus to get in there. In our guide-book said the bus stop parks just on the right side of the terminal exit and we found it quite easily because of its specific color : yellow-red. We catched bus number 07, it connects the airport to Kim Ma bus station. We jumped in, told the driver where we need to go but unfortunately, he didn&#x2019;t understand what I said. Other driver came closer and gave me two tickets , &#x201C;TWO PEOPLE&#x201D; &#x201C;TEN&#x201D; he smiled, showed his ten fingers and said to us like that. That meant, we need to paid ten thousand VND for two tickets. Quite cheap ! There were few people on the bus too, all of them were Vietnamese (I guessed) so I tried to talk with one young girl who seat above. We just thinked &#x201C; she is young and maybe she can speak English&#x201D;. Luckily, her English was quite good and she showed me where is &#x201C;NGA TU SO&#x201D; and how we can get there. The girl said we need to stop in &#x201C;CAU GIAY&#x201D; and catch one more bus. Our new office located in 131 NGUYEN TRAI and she said it is near by &#x201C;NGA TU SO&#x201D; so we can walk to there easily. We also had a small talk about Vienam with that girl, how interesting it is and some place we must to see in Hanoi like HOAN KIEM LAKE, Temple of Literature, Ngoc Son Temple, West Lake and many, many other places. The bus took us an hour to get in the city. Traffic in Hanoi is terrible with a tons of motorbike, vehicle, truck and I was dizzy a bit when walked on street. But HANOI has some hidden charm so you should find out and enjoy it !\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\r\n\t\t"
