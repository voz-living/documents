    Dear the highest!

    I'm a little guy who wants to make a little things and just want to earn a
    little money to survive through this bastardizing life. I know I was not a
    good person. I know, in the past, I used to live like a jerk. I know I was
    lost. I know I had totally destroyed my life. But plsss...Dear God, Jesus,
    Allah, Budda, The Lord, The Universe and all The Highest that ever exist in
    the world, plsss forgive me. Plsss give me a chance. Plsss help me walk
    through the bad days. Plsss shine the light on my dark life. I'm on my knees
    praying that you will help me find the right way to solve all of my
    problems.

    Thank you from the bottom of my heart.


    P/s: Hey guys, the truth is I don't have any experience in writing. So, if i
    make any mistakes, plsss correct me. Thank you!
