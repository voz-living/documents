Sorry but I did not mean to laugh at your pain but back in the time I was like you, I started going out at night, walked the street for hours, got home at 12 or 1am, took a hot shower then a very nice sleep came. Sometimes I was on my motorbike (or scooter as you might think) hitting the road, met new friends and talked to nice people, whomever I wanted to chat with. Life was so beautiful back there despite the heartbreaking. After 2 month, I forgot her as my new life came\r\n\t\t"
