In 2 hours class, the teacher only spends approximately 20 minutes on grammar. The rest are for discussions, work group, class activities,... I think those are what we lacked when learning English in Vietnam. Class activities make us so active in learning, that way we explore English and absorb it. Well, in Vietnam, students are so passive. The way we learn is like a damn tape recorder. How can we learn English when we don&#x2019;t have change to practice? You can&#x2019;t memorize it.
