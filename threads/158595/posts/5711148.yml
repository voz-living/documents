This is only one of the Superthread, in f16, so please don&apos;t be so &quot;academic&quot; when you see something wrong, not right, inaccurate... or anything like that. The purpose of this topic is making english not so academic, bored like in the gramar book at school time, so that everybody, not some of them can both learn  and improve their reading, thinking, and writing skill easily, and make them express themselves or what they want/need  better and faster.\r\n\t\t"
