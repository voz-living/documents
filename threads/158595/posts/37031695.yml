The link I gave you is just a mini-test, which can only grade your reading and listening skills. In fact,in the real Toefl, there would be human-being examiners listening to your speech and checking your writing.In addition, speaking section is a combination of independent speaking and integrated one, which requires you to speak after you listen and read about a topic.It is similar with the writing section in Toefl.That is why I suppose Toefl is tough(for me).If you don&apos;t think so,it&apos;s up to you. My business here is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n@iris I am 19.I admit that reading in Toefl is not very hard, but if you think that listening and writing are easier than that in IELTs,consider what I mentioned above.</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->my dear friend, this is how listening test in IELTS work: you need to listen to a long conversation (e.g. a man calls a store to order food for his house party) or an academic essay; note taking is NOT allowed; then answer many questions about the content of the conversation/essay (e.g. what types of food, quantity, special requirements, etc...).
