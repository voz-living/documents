Nevertheless, pronounce the &quot;TH&quot; sound while communicating with others is pretty hard. I&apos;m usually hesitant to make sure that I pronounce correctly, especially when 2 or 3 TH words stand consecutively. For example: &quot;The thing that&quot; -&gt; I cannot speak these 3 words fluently <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\">.
