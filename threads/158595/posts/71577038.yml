My name&apos;s Dung. I&apos;m 22 years old. I was born and grew up in HS district, HP province. I&apos;ve graduated from National Economics University of Ha Noi, majoring in economics.

I&apos;ve had experiences working in a property company  for 1 year. <br>\r\nMy strength is persistence, I work really hard and I don&apos;t give up easily. Besides , my strengths is that I&apos;m easily well-adapted to new working environment. I have the ability to grasp the job quickly. I&#x2019;m able to work under pressure. Furthermore, I&apos;m very serious in my work.<br>\r\nMy weakness, now, it is my experience. I&apos;m still young and I&apos;m a fresh graduate so I think working is the best way to gather experience and knowledge where one can develop multiple skills. <br>\r\nIn my life, my hobbies are music, football, traveling and chatting with my friends. In my job, I like the accuracy, the loyalty and the fair in work. I like to work in an self-motivated, friendly and challenging environment. I like team work and team building.

Live while i&apos;m young, I would like to devote to myself, family and social.
