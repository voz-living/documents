  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tHi guys, I have a question. We all know reduced relative clauses like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There are two students <u>who are waiting outside</u>. <br>\r\n= There are two students <b>waiting </b>outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strawberries <u>which had been dipped </u>in chocolate were really delicious! <br>\r\n= The strawberries <b>dipped </b>in chocolate were really delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo can use this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strawberries <u>which had been dipped </u>in chocolate were really delicious! <br>\r\n= The strawberries <b>being dipped </b>in chocolate were really delicious!\r\n\t\t"
