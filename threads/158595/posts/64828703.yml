And the amount of money that you can afford is one of the problems, too. We can&apos;t recommend you to buy a microphone (or headphone, if you meant it) with a price far more than what you can afford. On the other hands, if you pay too much for a microphone/headphone but you don&apos;t use with its best, then such a waste of money <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
