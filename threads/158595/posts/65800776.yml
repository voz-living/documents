    "of" doesn't have the ending sound (/f/), you must be mistaking it with
    "off"



    I usually pronounce the ending sound only on the stressed word in the
    sentence (probably because only these words sound clear enough to notice
    when speaking and to me it's too hard to have ending sound on all the words)
    and the easiest way to have them pronounced is combine sound
