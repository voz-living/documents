    When I was waiting for a bus tonight, I saw her. Then, an old man walked
    through who blew into the flute a folk song by his nose. She smiled. I was
    head over heels in her happy smiling face. Furthermore, I put my eyes on her
    eyes and saw something pure, something safe and sound. That was rude, maybe.
    But that's cool!
