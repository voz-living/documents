My brain does not allow me to do shitty job. So I&apos;m finding new opportunities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI&apos;m in a dilenma situation. I&apos;m working oversea. I don&apos;t really want to go back to Vietnam. My current job is like shit but pay damn well compared to my experience. I can afford my living by myself, travel when I want and save money for plan to learn Master degree in future <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I quit. And I don&apos;t have much opportunities when I cannot speak local language. I&apos;m not good enough to find a job in Singapore if anybody here will suggest. I&apos;m not mature enough to be qualified for mid level position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, basically I get stuck right now. Of course, I cannot have all I want. I&apos;m thinking about moving to do totally different thing like customer service? I&apos;ll go to a meeting event tonight to talk with founder of 1 target startup company. I don&apos;t know him and we have never talked before. I just know that they&apos;re finding people who can speak Vietnamese as a customer service agent. Not sure if they want a local who can speak Vietnamese or a native speaker though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be very awkward to start that talk but I will give it a shot. But I will need to recognize him among 100 people there tonight first haha (in case he shows up)\r\n\t\t"
