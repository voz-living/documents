They showed us how good they were as a companied team. We were really instinctive in the first half and almost paid off, but thank to our couple teammates, we gained advantages back before get into the second half. The game was really good and I&apos;m really sorry if I hasn&apos;t been in a party before the game happened, I would play better than that.
