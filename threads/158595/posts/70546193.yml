  Very interesting Longgosu.

  I think when I have my children I will not give them "the talk", because it
  seems phony, like to tell them not to do it too much because it's bad and all
  that. Instead I will make my children to be familiar with those things as
  early as possible, and in the most natural way. 

  Not to wait when they start to become adults to tell them what they've already
  know.
