    I don't know what to do now, i planned my life to study abroad and my goal
    is a MBA qualification of USA, but my parents and my uncle - a retired
    principal told me that USA was not safe for now, so they suggested me to
    study in Aus. They said that it was all up to me, because I have both
    scholarship in USA and Aus for University, I'm really confused now
