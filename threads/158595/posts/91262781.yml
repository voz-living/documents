    How anyone can master this language is beyond me.I'm not good at this,not
    even remotely close to say the least.I'm so incompetent I feel that
    everybody is out of my league as far as English is concerned.I'm just not on
    par with the vast majority of posters here,none of which,I assume(since I'm
    relatively new here as shown in my JD),is an English expert just yet.That's
    just how bad I am.
