  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI have been writing at here since i found out this thread! Such a fantastic place in order to release my emotion. Today is just routine work. Nothing to say except i am feeling so fuckin&apos; frustrated. Truly,  i have been joining an internship program since last month. As you knew, what the fuck is boring rather than sitting around and do nothing? yeah i am in that sittuation. Every day, i have to spent 8 hours to read documents in company. If this stuff still assign me in next days , it could makes me crazy up!!! No guide, nothing to do and just internet using! Prior to these day, i have already got a best offering from Intel corp. But in last minnutes, i had choose this firm because i wanna work in software development field, not in hardware. Nevertheless , life is not as dream, what i got is unexpected. So that, i must to finish 3 months at there. I hope my project manager could assign me some tasks which could inspire as well as wake up my deeply passion. Maybe in next month i will spend my last salary to travel somewhere.... I wanna go and forget everything behind me...\r\n\t\t"
