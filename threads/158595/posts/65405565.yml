    I got a problem with english, when someone read something stupid they
    usually say (or type) "what the hell did I just read !" but in my view, this
    isnt a question so we cant use "did I". It just shows a surprise or
    disappointed sense of the reader so the true clause should be: " what the
    hell i just read"    can anyone clear me with this problem???
