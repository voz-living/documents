  html: "\r\n\t\t\t<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: ad_showthread_firstpost_start -->\n\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: ad_showthread_firstpost_start -->\r\n\t\t\tHey guys, can anyone show me how to pronounce the &quot;TH&quot; sound efficiently in speaking English? I know the way to produce that sound and it doesn&apos;t have much difficulty when I speak a single word or a short sentence. Nevertheless, pronounce the &quot;TH&quot; sound while communicating with others is pretty hard. I&apos;m usually hesitant to make sure that I pronounce correctly, especially when 2 or 3 TH words stand consecutively. For example: &quot;The thing that&quot; -&gt; I cannot speak these 3 words fluently <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\">. So, are there any tips or advice for me with this problem <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/too_sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Too Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\">, I&apos;ll appreciate it so much.\r\n\t\t"

    Hey guys, can anyone show me how to pronounce the "TH" sound efficiently in
    speaking English? I know the way to produce that sound and it doesn't have
    much difficulty when I speak a single word or a short sentence.
    Nevertheless, pronounce the "TH" sound while communicating with others is
    pretty hard. I'm usually hesitant to make sure that I pronounce correctly,
    especially when 2 or 3 TH words stand consecutively. For example: "The thing
    that" -> I cannot speak these 3 words fluently . So, are there any tips or
    advice for me with this problem , I'll appreciate it so much.
