  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThank you very much black budda and Andy 3.1 , Toefl was my mistake in choosing English course. From the beginning, i just wanted to improve my English skills, so when my friends wanted me to join them in mr.Strong&apos;s class, I agreed immediately since the quality at some English centers was really bad. But look on the bright side, I have my skills improved very much after taking this course <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the master course, my major in university is economics management which is related to Business Management, so I think they might accept my bachelor and consider that I have finished BA degree. If I choose other major, I would have to take pre-master course, which could cost a lot more money and time.  This is my biggest consideration.<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n@andy: do you have any experience in this problem? plz share yours with me.<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
