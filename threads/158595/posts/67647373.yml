    Last night, I dreamed about all the girls from the past. 

    They're young, cute, hot, beautiful, sexy, great sense of style,
    like-no-other, nice personalities, almost perfect. And always have someone
    craving for.

    I still remember her sweet voice, you could taste it, like a candy melting
    in your mouth. A cotton candy, that must be it.

    I still remember the way she treat me. So kind. Like i were st very special.

    And when you said you "like" me, "like" like "like", and ask me whether we
    could be together.Well, I like you too, really really like you. But sorry,
    love is so far away. If there is something called next life...

    ....nah, probably not. 


    A sweet dream. A bittersweet dream.
