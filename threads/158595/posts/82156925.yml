I know the way to produce that sound and it doesn&apos;t have much difficulty when I speak a single word or a short sentence. Nevertheless, pronounce the &quot;TH&quot; sound while communicating with others is pretty hard. I&apos;m usually hesitant to make sure that I pronounce correctly, especially when 2 or 3 TH words stand consecutively. For example: &quot;The thing that&quot; -&gt; I cannot speak these 3 words fluently <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\">. So, are there any tips or advice for me with this problem <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/too_sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Too Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\">, I&apos;ll appreciate it so much.</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Well, if u can pronounce a single word correctly, I think you only need to practice more with sentences like &quot;The thing that&quot;. First, you just need to pronounce &quot;the&quot; &amp; &quot;thing&quot; &amp; &quot;that&quot; separately. Then slowly connect them. <br>\r\nMore importantly, you need to make sure you actually pronounce the &quot;TH&quot; sound right. Maybe ask a foreigner or teacher to check.\r\n\t\t"
