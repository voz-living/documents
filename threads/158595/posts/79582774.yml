Hey dude, I have never encountered a guy as desperate as you. You know what, all of that trash talk just give you a tag of &quot;small mind&quot;, a selfish guy who does not want to give away anything without gaining something back in return. You get paid for doing nothing, that&apos;s not my problem nor is it anyone else&apos;s problem. Yo mama taught you &quot;you get what you give&quot; ? Thank you, your mom is a wise woman however her son isn&apos;t. I give out help, I receive help back in return. Does that make sense to you ? I thank you for recognizing my mental illness, because helping others for no reason is an illness then I would gladly accept it, you can crawl back in your little hole of a mind and sleep in there. I will not seek medical attention to cure this illness of mine as I can see the result post-treatment from you man. Many people donated to charity without actually seeing their money being put into good use, are they all mentally ill ? Who hurt you so bad that you turned out to be this hopeless ? Look at your comments, did you even give me a reasonable explanation on why I should not have helped ? However I can tell you this, helping him posted no threat to my family or my future whatsoever nor did it take a lot of my time, to be honest I was shitting while typing up that post instead of browsing the web reading trash comments like yours. I did not get offended by your comment, it just made me curious on how life can be so entertaining, you are a rare breed my son, a rare breed indeed. You brought up my insecurity ? Ha ha ha dude I have everything I could ever wanted, it was just that life took me by surprise by introducing you to me <img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->And that settled my expectations from you. I thought you could at least put up a fight, but you are changing the subject man, you&apos;re giving me what you want to say from what you think of me. Did I even say you shouldn&apos;t help people because I don&apos;t recall saying that. And I was recognizing your generosity for helping people, so neither I said it in the wrong way or you misinterpreted it. <br>\r\nOh and the thing of me getting paid for doing nothing was to justified against your go to sleep statement and believe me, I would if I could. <br>\r\nAnd you&apos;re happy with everything you got, that&apos;s really great you must be really blessed. Because I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll never be satisfied with anything, if I have a million bucks, I will want 2 mils. Never be satisfied or you will go to places, not college tho, but places. Or is that what they teach you in your college, then ok, keep telling yourself that.<br>\r\nI&apos;m done with you, kiddo. Call me small mind all you want, small mind but making big bucks then I&apos;m down with even being called bird brain. <br>\r\nMake another argument, something that&apos;s somehow even remotely relevant to what I&apos;ve said. Then we can have a debate. Right now, you&apos;re just crying out for &quot;help&quot;. Be sure to read it carefully and comprehend everything I&apos;ve said because you&apos;re making no senses right now. <br>\r\nTake your time, my shift is almost over and I&apos;m heading home to sleep. Good luck to you tho, I really think you gonna need lotsa that. <br>\r\nIn the end, it only matters when it&apos;s come to family and money. If you ain&apos;t my family and you&apos;re in no way of making me money, be sure that Imma screw you over.\r\n\t\t"
