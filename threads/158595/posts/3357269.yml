    Bro Teng, could you help me choose between East Coast and West Coast? ppl
    lately lectured so much on pros and cons of each side but I am still
    ambivalent. The South is , on the other hand, a mystery to me, so it'll be
    great if you can tell more about Southern ppl, life. Southerners don't
    really friendly, do they? I was such a retard that I threw deposits to three
    schools in three different locations. I be doomed if they find out.
