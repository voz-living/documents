    The best way to improve your listening skill is watching TV and movies.
    While watching TV, you should watch some interesting channels such as
    Discovery, National Geographic ... it's easier to listen to those channels
    in contrast to others. The point here is to keep your interest to something.
    It won't make you getting bored.
