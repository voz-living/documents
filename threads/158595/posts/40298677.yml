Therefore, we often observe positions of things around us in a subjective way. For example: m&#xE2;y tr&#xEA;n tr&#x1EDD;i, c&#xE1; d&#x1B0;&#x1EDB;i n&#x1B0;&#x1EDB;c, xe ngo&#xE0;i &#x111;&#x1B0;&#x1EDD;ng,...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the contrary, Western cultures observe objectively the way things are, or observe the position of one thing in its own position with its surroundings. So, English say : cloud in the sky, fish in the water, cars on the road,...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPay attention to this because you may make some preposition mistakes when using English.\r\n\t\t"
