Why? Of all people why my mum? at such young age? A little relieved though as many sites said breast cancer can be cured now with very high survival rates, especially when it was detected at the early stages, but.. mum is already losing her hair because of chemo <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/cry.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Cry\" class=\"inlineimg\">, i dont know what is going on her mind, since I&apos;m already feeling lost and useless, her only 2 kids are away from home and wont even come back this year for holidays. The GUILT, it&apos;s killing, but i can&apos;t go home yet..<br>\r\nI hope you will make it, please let her make it, idk, please...\r\n\t\t"
