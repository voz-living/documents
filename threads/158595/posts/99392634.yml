You seem to be so self-righteous and overly confident. You wanted to advertise your service, but when a potential customer came you showed him/her your bad attitude. Everyone can be your customer, but first you should not deter 'em away with your egocentric mannerism. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\n\n- it is you that drive the conversation away from its origin with the so called advice. So you'd better learn how to give advice or just pay attention to what you are about to write.\n\n- your opinions about me is your problem. Dont tell it to me if its not mine since I didnt quote you. Just you coming to me with that attitude and you asked for the good?. Stop approaching people with that way.\n\n- yes i did advertise my service and i did see whats behind his comment. Dont lure me with the argument that he should have been treated like the potential one. \n\n- so yeah be direct to your previous quote concerning the bla bla robot thing.really appreciate that Or just peace out. Look at your post again and see the words. Not sure if Knowing 6 languages is an obstacle for you to choose the words"
