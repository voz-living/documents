It&apos;s not easy to answer, but there&apos;re some steps you<font color=\"Blue\"> may </font>follow if you want to find <font color=\"Blue\">the ?</font>half of yours. Firstly, you must have some information about the girl that you&apos;re interested in such as phone number, nickname, address, birthday, hobby, etc... That&apos;s <font color=\"Blue\">the</font> basic information you must know when you want to make friend or <font color=\"Red\">pay attention ???</font> to her. You can talk <font color=\"Blue\">and/or</font> chat with her or even her friends to get those kind<font color=\"Blue\">s</font> of information. After that, when you and that girl have already known each other, you can move to<font color=\"Blue\"> the</font> second step -<font color=\"Blue\"> flirting</font>. In this step, you need to prepare a lot of things like gift and/or flower. Do you know a sudden present always make girls feel <font color=\"Blue\">surprised. </font>. <font color=\"Blue\">Sometime,</font> <font color=\"Blue\">going out </font>to a park or cinema is a good idea too. And when <font color=\"Blue\">you&apos;ve had a</font> closer relation with her, third step is ready for you. This is the final step and, I believe, the most important part because it&apos;s time <font color=\"Blue\">you declare your love to her</font>. Therefore, you have to make sure that you choose a right time to do it. A romantic or your own favorite place is a good suggestion for you and if everything is fine after you express your love to her, a kiss will make both of you happier. It&apos;s always hard <font color=\"Blue\">to win</font> a girl&apos;s heart, but I strongly believe if you follow <font color=\"Blue\">the</font> above steps, you will succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, first of all, the steps you mentioned are too general, most of the guys here can easily provide you with similar guides. So they are for reference only. One may not need to follow all of them to triumph and following all of them does not guarantee success. The most important thing is sincerity. Also important is how that girl feels about you. Gifts mean nothing if she is indifference. OK Now back to the writing.\r\n\t\t"
