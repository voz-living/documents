I think you guys already know what &quot;not enough&quot; means. And now, she&apos;s gone. Lol, how sad. I need to accept the truth, because, this is real life with real things not a fairytale with a lot of miracles. Love, love, love. Money, money, money.

    Hi guys, I'm Escality and I'm a loser. Really! I lose almost everything. My
    love, my job, my money, my power...even myself. My life is a mess now.
    Everything's so fucked up. I'm living a dead life.


    A few weeks ago, the love of my life said "Love is not enough for me and i
    don't have enough strength to fight for what we have". I think you guys
    already know what "not enough" means. And now, she's gone. Lol, how sad. I
    need to accept the truth, because, this is real life with real things not a
    fairytale with a lot of miracles. Love, love, love. Money, money, money.
    Reality sucks!


    Btw, if anyone's curious about my nick name "Escality, it's a shortcut of
    "Escape from reality". Lol...sometimes, i really want to escape from
    reality.
