    I really want to take my English to the next level but I'm f*cking lazy.
    Everyday, I remind myself that I have to improve my English but it doesn't
    help . I do have free time after work but I can't force myself to learn
    anything new. I'm lacking inspiration, passion and motivation. Sometimes,
    life is boring as hell.
