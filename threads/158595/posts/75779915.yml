  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI have a really weird question for you, guys: Have you ever thought about killing someone you love? I don&apos;t ask about your nemesis or someone you hate. What I want to know is whether you guys can kill your loved one by your own hand or not. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/go.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Go\" class=\"inlineimg\"> <br>\r\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, you don&apos;t have to be a cold blood killer in this case.
