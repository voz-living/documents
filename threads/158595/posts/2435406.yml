It&apos; so hard to choose, right ? I experienced it. Actually, there&apos;re so many, many universities you can choose. It&apos;s up to your ability and your favourite. I think studying in Hanoi or Saigon, etc is not the main problem. Can you tell me more about you ? I mean what kind of university you like or where&apos;re you living... ? The more info from you, the more easy we can talk to each other, I hope so <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->thanks, you&apos;re so kind.<br>\r\ni&apos;m living in quang tri, it&apos;s not developed very well anh i want to have an effective enviroment in university. i can&apos;t express myself very well in english but i think i am a gentle, kind, hospitalble, creative and dynamic man . so the problem is that i want to learn marketing and i still don&apos;t know where is better.<br>\r\nfor myself, i prefer ho chi minh than ha noi because of the hospitalble people there. <br>\r\nhope it helps ^^^\r\n\t\t"
