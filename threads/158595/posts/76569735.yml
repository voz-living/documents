To be precise, I want to achieve something in life rather than live a normal life without a goal. Some only need to enjoy life, easy come easy go, and never plan ahead. They are like, just go with the flow. They live for the moment, not for future. They either are the happy-go-lucky people, or the criminal kinds who are lost in life and do whatever they desire even if it means killing someone. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/go.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Go\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
