Nowadays people often use the word \"Thím\" to refer to others while communicating with them, often their friends, for a totally different purpose. Sometimes it can underlie the purpose of making fun of someone who personality is quite girly. Thus, there is really no real translation of \"Thím\" in English, since the word has been used in conversations in a totally different way than it is meant to be used.
