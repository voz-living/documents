    I don't know how to combine two seperate words to make a compound word. Ex:
    I don't know using either " Industrial production" or "industry production"
    is right? Sometimes we use "Adj+noun" and sometimes it's " Noun+noun". It
    made me really confuse when getting words to make sentences.
