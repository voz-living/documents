  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tNight falls, lights on, It&apos;s when the feels and the anxieties take over me. I&apos;ve stopped taking pills for over a week now and It feels like hell for most of the time. Wish I knew how to smoke, so I could put myself to sleep painlessly, no more &quot;anxiety control&quot; shit. But then again, the feeling that I&apos;m destroying myself by smoking only makes my anxieties worse. Fuck me, like everything tries to screw me over. Wasting my time doing things I don&apos;t like, too many expectations, everybody is counting on me to do something great. And I do have a great news for them, I&apos;m not feeling great at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI&apos;ve been an introvert my whole life, maybe because I learnt from a family that the father has every fucking rights to beat up his child if the mother is getting all the money, you better shut your fucking mouth if you don&apos;t want your ass whooped. If you can&apos;t hit your money maker and you only have a child, who to beat when your gambling went wrong, your job is shit, and you need to take it on somebody? I don&apos;t blame him, if I was in that deep shit, I would do the same, just not on my child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving in a society that only need you when you&apos;re good lamb, follow the top ones, try to be like one, and keep every god damned &quot;original thoughts&quot; for yourself because no one gives a shit about it. You go to college, you find a job, you pay debts and die. That&apos;s it, if you do it right, people won&apos;t spit on your graves and you won&apos;t disgrace your family. We&apos;re all thieves, we don&apos;t &quot;earn&quot; things, you just steal them from somebody else. You get a good job? You stole that from somebody else. You got a raise? you stole that from someone who just got fired. Only thing that matters is that can you be a better thief? Fuck it, We&apos;re not paying our skills, our knowledges and other bullshits to earn a virtual thing called &quot;money&quot;, we&apos;re paying time of our lives to get it. And right now, my time worths shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can&apos;t sleep, I can&apos;t focus on anthing, the thoughts of interacting with people with bullshits are killing me, maybe that what really makes people get cancer. Drowning in shits I can&apos;t handle, struggling to get by without doing anything. I&apos;m meaningless, my lfie is meaningless. It&apos;s a miracle that I haven&apos;t thought of suicide nor tried to. And I know I won&apos;t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, I really do need to get a smoke right now..\r\n\t\t"
