It&apos;s not hard because there are so many English speakers, it&apos;s very widely used.

No, you are wrong. I&apos;ve seen many of my friends and those who struggle in English class even though English is their first language. People don&apos;t write the same way they talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start, I think you have to learn basic grammar structure. I mean you don&apos;t have to learn grammar to write like a professional writer. Most of us will never be at that level anyway. Basic grammar understanding will help you when it comes to writing because using the right tense will help express your idea or thinking on paper more accurate. And when you speak, it will be a lot easier for people to understand what you are saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, people don&apos;t write the same way they talk. So learning to speak, let words come out naturally is also a challenge but it can be challenged. Watch movie, news is one way, it helps you learn how English is spoken. But scripted conversations will not help you improve as much as having direct, real conversation. Since we all are interested in hi-tech, why don&apos;t you guys form a group and practice with each others. Let&apos;s say open a chat room. If you are too shy to talk, write it down and someone will help you.
