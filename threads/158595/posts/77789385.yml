In fact, it&apos;s not only ridiculous but also creepy as hell. How can you fall in love with anyone if you haven&apos;t met him/her in real life? Their personality on the Internet might be different to their personality in real life. The person you think you are in love with is the one they show you but not the one they truly are. I used to date a girl who I knew from an online dating site. On the Internet, she was a talkative person. But in real life, she didn&apos;t talk much.\r\n\t\t"

In fact, it's not only ridiculous but also creepy as hell. How can you fall in love with anyone if you haven't met him/her in real life? Their personality on the Internet might be different to their personality in real life. The person you think you are in love with is the one they show you but not the one they truly are. I used to date a girl who I knew from an online dating site. On the Internet, she was a talkative person. But in real life, she didn't talk much."
