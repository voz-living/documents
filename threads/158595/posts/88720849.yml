    I've been writting down every new word  I found and translated it during
    reading an English article,watching movies or listening to music. It's not
    necessarily a whole new word, maybe ones I already know but quite forget how
    to use them in certain circumstances . It's like waking up my inner power
    lol.Doing me wonders.
