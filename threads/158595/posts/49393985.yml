But, I can not find out any answer else to meet your question. Im using one E71, ok, im satisfied with this one. My brother - earns more 10m per month, using one 1208, and he satisfies his. And you, use one which has been in your pocket for more 5 years, ok, if its still good, and you feel nothing &apos;s wrong with your phone, so thats right, isnt that?
