Actually, there&apos;re so many, many universities you can choose. It&apos;s up to your ability and your favourite. I think studying in Hanoi or Saigon, etc is not the main problem. Can you tell me more about you ? I mean what kind of university you like or where&apos;re you living... ? The more info from you, the more easy we can talk to each other, I hope so <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
