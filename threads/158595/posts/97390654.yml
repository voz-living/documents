  Please help me ! Correct this paragraph 

  _____

  My favourite subject in school is English. Because it's the key to success by
  the following three characteristics.

  Firstly, English is easy to learn. It's a simple language because if you spend
  2 hours studying grammars, listening to naturally-spoken English and reading
  English books a day, you won't be a bad score at school. Consequently, your
  score in english national exam, too.

  Secondly, English is "treasure communications". It's the third-most common
  language, therefore many of the world's top films, books and musics are
  published and produced in English that give me an opportunity to learn more
  knowledge.

  Finally, English is skill important in the workplace, knowing English
  increases your chances of getting a good job in a mutinational company within
  your home country or finding work abroad.

  In short, English is not only useful but also important in our life
