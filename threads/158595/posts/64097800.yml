I think i know the meaning of the words &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;upcoming&quot; well, but the problem are their uses. They are confusing words, just like &quot;raise&quot; and &quot;rise&quot;, &quot;me&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, &quot;aloud&quot; and &quot;loudly&quot;, &quot;practice&quot; and &quot;practise&quot;, etc. Seriously, sometimes even native speakers use these words incorrectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, thanks for pointing that one out <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">.\r\n\t\t"
