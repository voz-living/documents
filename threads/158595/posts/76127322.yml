In fact, i had purchased a secondhand motobike from a bitch in HCM city. She told me that her freakin&apos; motobike is still good and it&apos;s absolutely unspoiled. Yeah it was also my fault when i have not check it carefully. So that, I have been reparing this one since i got it from her! Such a fucking bitch! Y know! I am just a poor student so 3-4 minilon is big amount to me. I swear that i will never buy anything from secondhand source as this time. Yeah i had understood what the fuck life is and how much i have to pay when put belief in other. Sometimes , you would like to be a good man but what it brings back so fuckin&apos; awful. This&apos;s just some words i wanna write down in order to release my stress. It will be blooding lesson for me....\r\n\t\t"
