Truly, this is the first time i<br>\r\nwent to work at a real company even though its just an internship program. My instructor has given me a development kit and mash of documents. What guess? I just have 2 weeks in order to handle all of datas about this kit. Such a nightmare! I have to finish a big project which i&apos;ve never seen at my university. Fortunately, i&apos;ll receive 200$ allowance per month and its really made me feel so fucking happy because while my classmate was going to work as me but they just worked for free to learning and get trainning program from their firms.I am feeling so good due to i have earned money in second year. I thought all of this fortunes depend on my English skills just because i have no ideas when they asked me about techniques even they are just simple questions. Until now , i have already gotten the meaning of foreign languages when you are in an interview or job searching.So that, i highly recommend new freshers or students, especially is future technicians. Besides that, you need also to improve your soft skills, such as communication or teamwork ..eg.. Okay, here is just some words what i really tell to vozers who is student as well as unemployers. Remember that&apos;s Without struggles , there are no succesfull! Have a nice day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours sincerely,<br>\r\na Bitch from uit LOL\r\n\t\t"
