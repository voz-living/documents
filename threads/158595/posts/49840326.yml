The most important thing is that you can catch the keywords( I mean the new words and important words) in that page and you can understand what it wanna deliver. Besides, you don&apos;t need to learn by heart at once all the new words, just separate them into period of time, maybe a few times per day. Furthermore, look the words up in dictionary to have accurate pronunciation. Good luck^^\r\n\t\t"
