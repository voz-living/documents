I don&apos;t know but you will have to sort it out by yourself.<br>\r\nHere is some basic knowledge about TOEFL and IELTS ( i never take IELTS but i did some research about it as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n TOEFL: They will use American Accent for everything. They really don&apos;t care much about you making a minor mistake in vocabulary / sentences (or they are not nit-picking type) . But the thing they care : is how you understand the point of the question and how you develop the answer. As long as you don&apos;t make major mistake in choosing sentences or answer it wrong, you will be alright. They use the multiple choice question as the format of the test and it will remain years and years, so it is kinda easier to prepare for TOEFL, since IELTS Test format get changed every year.<br>\r\n Basically, prepare yourself for some good knowledge about some familiar topic that might happen everyday at school or at home, be familiar with the American Accent (because the Listening part will use this accent, be sure that you can listen to it clearly ). Don&apos;t focus totally on the grammar thing, just take a short review on the normal grammars and for sure : vocabulary. As i mentioned above, you will do just fine as long as you understand the question well and answer directly to the question that they ask. But just because of that, please don&apos;t think that TOEFL is easy. The multiple choice can screw you up easily when they can throw many and many trick questions in the choices.The listening part, you can listen to the dialogue once ONLY. You have ONLY 15 to 20 SECS to think , understand and develop an answer, and then, you have about 20-30 SECS to speak your answer in the SPEAKING section. Which is extremely hard and nit-picking, just because they really care if you can understand the questions and the situation by yourself or NOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Writting part will be in 2 major parts : Once with a topic / an article from a newspaper and you will have to answer one question by an essay. Minimum is 500 words i think, i am not sure, you will have to recheck.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The Second part will be on a daily topic and you have no material except your own experience with it. Some topic might be easy, might be very difficult. Like mine was &quot;How do you think stress effect your life?&quot; . Once again, they care about how you answer and understand the question, minor mistakes can be forgiven<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIELTS: First major difference : they will use British Accent and several Accent that close to the British one (Like Australia... or some nation in the EU group), they will use paper test instead of the Internet Based like TOEFL.<br>\r\n They will look through your paper and see what you can get down in the paper . Or i mean, they will be looking for grammatical errors , they will care about the choice of words you use, how it match with others parts of the sentences . Most of students at Viet Nam decides to take IELTS just because we study like really hard about grammar at High School / College. <br>\r\n The Listening part of IELTS will be held in a different day of the test, when you actually have to speak to a reprensatative , like a real interview. This could be a broken deal or not. It depends on what type of person you are. It might scare you to death , or you just feel more comfortable to have someone talk to you and even explain the questions for you if you don&apos;t totally understand it. As i said, it either a broken deal, or a good chance to score good in the Speaking / Listening part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Well , best of luck for you, be sure you test yourself for an accent listening first, if you think British Accent is better with your ears, then IELTS is most likely to be your best option. <br>\r\n But if you can understand question very quickly, and strong in Listening/Speaking with some minor mistakes , you better be off with TOEFL. Remember , TOEFL is kinda nit-picking in the time you have to answer the question in Listening/Speaking Part.<br>\r\nAnd One major point of difference between this 2 tests: TOEFL is designed for Purpose of studying in United States , while IELTS is designed by British. Almost every school nowdays accept both tests, but better to be prepared right to your choice of study.<br>\r\n Best of Luck, let me know if you still have any question about TOEFL.\r\n\t\t"
