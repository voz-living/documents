If we want to perfect English, be immersed in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, make yourself a daily habit of reading English articles. Don&apos;t be afraid of seeing a new word which you haven&apos;t seen before. If you scare or just too lazy to search for it in the dictionary, you probably will never improve your English. Learning English through gaming, movie, etc... is also excellent.\r\n\t\t"
