I left my home for university in 2002, and spent most of my time with Play Station 1 &amp; 2. That was the time of Winning Eleven, Pro Evolution Soccer, Final Fantasy X ...<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\"> Then in 2004 I Vinagame bought JX 1 from Kingsoft and brought it to Vietnam<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\">, and I wasted about 12 hours per day to live in that virtual world<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\">. I also fell in love with a classmate, who helped me a lot in learning. I went to class just enough not to be suspended from exams<img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\">, but luckily I passed all the exams with the help of my girlfriend. One thing I was different from you is that my classmates liked me <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\"> as I was always available if they needed some support. After graduation, I still spent time for games, and my girlfriend&apos;s family didn&apos;t accept me because they wanted their daughter to marry a man, not a boy. Then we were apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don&apos;t really know what has changed my life, maybe I myself, maybe my new girlfriend who is my wife now, maybe my job that is more &quot;attractive&quot; than the games, or maybe it&apos;s just a matter of time i.e. when time goes by, you get older not only in your age but also in your thoughts. Only thing I know for sure now is that &quot;time is the most valuable thing in the world&quot;. I don&apos;t have enough time for my job, my family and my studying. Yes, studying. I realize that if I stop studying, I will fall behind this moving life <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/feel_good.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Feel Good\" class=\"inlineimg\"> I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m successful now, but I can feel my value in things I&apos;m doing. You&apos;re much better than me as you realize that you need to change even before graduation. May you can do what you want, and may you  and your gf can be together<img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/beauty.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Beauty\" class=\"inlineimg\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Change doesn&apos;t mean success, but I believe that I need to change right now.

Although she refuse my invite, but I believe that she is a good person, hard working. It is dangerous if she accept my first invite. Hope that I choose the right person.\r\n\t\t"
