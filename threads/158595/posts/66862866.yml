    you are perfectly right. Every written thing supposed to be, at least in
    here, formal. Perhaps, you are misunderstood my post above. Summing up, I
    have learnt a lot of structures and vocabulary from what you have posted
    here. And, admittedly, it is quite helpful. But, 1 more thing, the general
    English level of, what we may call, "Vozer" is not that high. It is very
    difficult for them to follow up. So my theory is to standardize the level
    first and then, when they got the basic platform, they can study it further
