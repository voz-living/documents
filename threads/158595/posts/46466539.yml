When I wore it the first time, I was amazed because there was a hole in the left sleeve. What more is the shirt was not cheap and I believe that I paid enough for the quality. Afterwards, I took the shirt to the salesperson who i bought it from. However, she refused to exchange the shirt as well as refused to let me talk to the manager. Therefore, I write this complain letter in hope of gaining satisfaction (wtf?). Herewith i have enclosed the shirt&apos;s receipt which includes the price and date on which it was purchased. I will be very grateful if you could send me a reply as soon as possible. Im looking forward to hearing from you.<br>\r\nThanks in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nis it what you&apos;re looking for? The sentences sound silly though, idk..\r\n\t\t"
