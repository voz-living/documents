But recently I find that she and my close friend (I have two close friend, he&apos;s one of them and we&apos;ve been friends since I was seven) are likely to like each other... I&apos;ve been loving her for 6 years, since we were at school together. It hurts so bad.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAbout two week ago, 2/12, she and I talked together until nearly 12 pm. I said something like &quot;If I were you, I&apos;d stay up late until my birthday came&quot;. And she said that she was happy that I remembered her birthday. The following day, I gave her a present. It was a book named &quot;Mat Biec&quot; by Nguyen Nhat Anh...<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nShe&apos;s like the weather. But I love her. Am I going to lose both you and my close friend, Velvety Rose?<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nIs anyone here? I just want to share my story, because I&apos;m gonna be like the main character in Mat Biec, Ngan. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
