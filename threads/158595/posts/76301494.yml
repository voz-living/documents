The 4-eyed f*cker wears a black fedora. On his shirt is a GTA logo. Hanging on his wall is a giant GRAND THEFT AUTO V poster next to a Homer Simpsons-shaped map... He is a f*cking loser for sure. He uses his useless fingers that he also uses to jerk off to child porn and post random sh*t on 4chan (just so you know, he does those things on daily basis)...and types into Firefox: &quot;gtaforums.com&quot;. Grabbing the Razer mouse, he goes into the PC section, gigging for no f*cking reason and then clicks on the latest post of the topic called &quot;GTA V and Steam&quot;. The topic gathers a bunch of losers, just like him, who are desperate for news of the PC version of a f*cking video game of some random company called &quot;Rockstar Games&quot;. He has been doing this for over 4 months. Still no news. He sighs...before posting a bait in the thread and leaving. 2 hours passed. The nerd accidentally fell asleep watching Boogie2988 smashing Xbox 360 that he&apos;s watched a million times. On his other tab is /r/pcmasterrace. Suddenly, his mom walks in. He wakes up, still mumbling about how he desperately wants a classy, charming girlfriend. &quot;What do you want for dinner?&quot; - His mother asks. &quot;Anything mom&quot; - He replies and then smiles, followed by his mom&apos;s. He didn&apos;t mean any of it. After his mom closed the door, he lies on his bed and starts crying...He&apos;s asking God for a sign. He JUST WANTS A SIGN. Beyond and above, God is laughing. The nerd&apos;s taken 20 Advil. He dies a happy life....Or so they said.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\r\n\t\t"
