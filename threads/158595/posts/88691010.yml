It doesn&apos;t mean I say stupid or insulting words. It just means that my head gradually empty itself after a while and the words just simply come out from my mouth (pretty like when you talk about something you like and you say so many things that you get &quot;lost&quot;). I don&apos;t know if this is a good thing or not because I can speak kinda fluently thanks to it. However the idea of getting lost sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable\r\n\t\t"

    About speaking English, I have a problem: after speaking for a while, it
    seems like I can't control my mouth like when I speak VNese. It doesn't mean
    I say stupid or insulting words. It just means that my head gradually empty
    itself after a while and the words just simply come out from my mouth
    (pretty like when you talk about something you like and you say so many
    things that you get "lost"). I don't know if this is a good thing or not
    because I can speak kinda fluently thanks to it. However the idea of getting
    lost sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable
