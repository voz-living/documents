If I have one of those I&apos;ll have to decide whether to use the trackpad, keyboard or touchscreen each time I want to do something. And that&apos;s is just plain right inconvenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI&apos;m still using my (used to be) trusty 9000 and honestly, I like the trackball best. Call me old school but I like the feel of it. The trackpad just doesn&apos;t feel right.
