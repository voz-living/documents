And by experience, I don&apos;t mean experience of a successful individual. It&apos;s just me, being older than you and having treaded on paths that I want you to avoid at all cost.

Therefore, I think it&apos;s better if we greet it as earlier as possible i.e. when we&apos;ve got nothing to lose or to fear.</b> It will do good to you, someone whose rule of thumb is to always have plan B. Trust me. About your parents, you&apos;ve just got to stop dramatising the whole situation. Fret not if they cry or yell at you, just the fact that their first words upon learning your situation were encouragement tells it own weight. They&apos;ll stand by you, always and unconditionally.

You won&apos;t aim for FTU, you&apos;ll aim for a second-tier university, where you&apos;ll have time to recharge and rethink. I don&apos;t think applying for RMIT is a wise choice, given your long-term goal. Also, how much do you think your parents can stretch in term of finance? You know, achieving scholarship is certainly the best launchpad.
