    as we know, Vo Nguyen Giap,our nationally legendary hero has passed away.
    and form the bottom of my heart.i've been so sorry and i think its a loss of
    our country which goes beyond the words of mouth. and today's morning i went
    on Fb and read so many information as well as status regarding to the news
    of Vo Nguyen Giap's death. and I noticed a status of a girl,who i've just
    known on FB, her status content is like:" so General has gone to meet my
    grandfather". the first thing i thought when i read this status is :"who the
    fuck does she think her grandfather is". i know that ,to each of us, our
    grandgather and grandmother as well is so important but this man is the hero
    of our entire country , and the pride of our country and she thought that he
    would have given a fuck to meet her fucking grandfather in another world
    .it's ridiculous ). by the way, the only one i thought Vo Nguyen Giap has
    gone to meet is our Uncle Ho. the main point i wanna say here is that : we
    need show our respect for our hero not only because he's the main factor of
    the Victory of two our national wars in the past ,but also because that if
    it wasnt him,our country might have been in a Civil War
