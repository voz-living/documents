    There is a speed mode function on youtube that allows you to
    decrease/increase the speed of videos. Interacting with native speakers is
    significantly efficient in improving speaking and listenning. Most
    importantly, you can learn how to speak naturally not word by word or paying
    too much attention on grammar.
