    Software world í too large, you need to catch your point. 

    There are many computer languages today. Its depend on which layer you are
    interested in.

    For example: if you like to work with application software, server
    application you should learn C/C++, Java, Python...

    Web developer: you should learn HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL...

    Its very important to catch your own point in this time before its late.

    they teach you at scholl? Sorry about my question but I have never learnt
    any IT school!
