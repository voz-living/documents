    Have you guys ever had the thought that you couldn't love anyone else but
    her? She's now married but still I couldn't get over her. The feelings that
    we could've worked it out, turned things around won't go away. Every night,
    lying on the bed, I wonder "what did I do wrong? Why did we fall apart?" And
    the best answer I could find is "I'm not the one"
