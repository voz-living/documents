  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tLast week, I sent my CV to apply for the position A and I was invited to test and interview. After testing IQ, Gmath and technical knowledge, I was one of 5 people who got the high score. I was actually surprised at this. However, when I was interviewed, I could not meet their requirements for the position A. I knew it before going here, I only want to get experience. Of course, I was failed but the director offered the other position for me. I had other test and I did it well. He was satisfied with me. I agreed to him with the position B. The position B is suitable for my major so I am very happy about this. <br>\r\nHowever, yesterday I received an email announcing that I was failed. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/too_sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Too Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\"> <br>\r\nWhat? Why?
