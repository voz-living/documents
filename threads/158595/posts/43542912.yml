Just bought a buff headwear this afternoon at Coixuong for 80k, after checking the price at gifthaus which was double (160k), not to mention that they looked bad. And now I accidently go to an online shop and it costs only 50k for one! I swear I will never buy anything at those 2 shops anymore! so fucking expensive for things that are not worth the amount.\r\n\t\t"

    Holyfuck! Just bought a buff headwear this afternoon at Coixuong for 80k,
    after checking the price at gifthaus which was double (160k), not to mention
    that they looked bad. And now I accidently go to an online shop and it costs
    only 50k for one! I swear I will never buy anything at those 2 shops
