  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tOn the wedding day of my friend which was held 4 days ago, i met his niece, but she is just 2 years old younger than me. My god, she was so beautiful, i couldn&apos;t stop watching her doing stuff. Then that day, i realized that i fell in love with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, i told my friend that i wanted to know her phone number. But he said she didn&apos;t want to give me her phone number because she was shy. I don&apos;t know why, may be my appearance isn&apos;t enough for her to care, or just may be she hadn&apos;t wanted to have a boyfriend yet. I&apos;ve just remembered that my friend told me one more thing. He said there were several boys wanted to date with her already, but she didn&apos;t care at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when i found her facebook, i tried to add her, and luckily, she accepted my request. And now i&apos;m trying to comment to her photo and take her attention. I think she already knew who i am, and she repplied any single comments of mine in her photo happily, this make me feel so glad and tell myself to keep going like this until she like me. Then i can date her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm i doing it right ?\r\n\t\t"
