And by experience, I don&apos;t mean experience of a successful individual. It&apos;s just me, being older than you and having treaded on paths that I want you to avoid at all cost. Yes, these are words of a man-boy who is in the middle of nowhere in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFailure is inevitable, that&apos;s the fact. Therefore, I think it&apos;s better if we greet it as earlier as possible i.e. when we&apos;ve got nothing to lose or to fear. It will do good to you, someone whose rule of thumb is to always have plan B. Trust me. About your parents, you&apos;ve just got to stop dramatising the whole situation. Fret not if they cry or yell at you, just the fact that their first words upon learning your situation were encouragement tells it own weight. They&apos;ll stand by you, always and unconditionally. Do not feel pressured, just remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what to do? If your long-term goal is to study overseas, just take the national university entrance test. Try as best as you can. You won&apos;t aim for FTU, you&apos;ll aim for a second-tier university, where you&apos;ll have time to recharge and rethink. I don&apos;t think applying for RMIT is a wise choice, given your long-term goal. Also, how much do you think your parents can stretch in term of finance? You know, achieving scholarship is certainly the best launchpad. However, it&apos;s not necessarily the only one, there are plenty of ways to show your consideration towards your parents while studying abroad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPM me if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest of luck.</font>\r\n\t\t"
