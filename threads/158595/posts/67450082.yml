You act like you're in the big crowd called \"social\", but you're not. You're afraid of being alone. No one really cares about you. You try to deny it by going to work, having kids, living the \"dream\" and assume it's \"happiness\". But no. YOU ARE ALONE. Life is just a boring and long dream. What happens after your death...is the truth."
