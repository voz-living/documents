  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tHi, everyone, this is not the first time I comment in this thread. My clone was banned 4ever, so I use my real account now. I feel that I fall in love with my classmate and I try to talk with her. Luckily,thanks to doing homework, I have a good way to approach her instead of normal ways. She is a kind of talkative people in comparison with me. She also told me how to have a girl friend, which make me cannot stop laughing. I know that it is hard for me to say to her about my feeling because I am a kind of shy person, but I think I make a good strategy for the first step. Do you guys think so? <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
