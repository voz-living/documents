    Is there anyone here help me translate this into Vietnamese? 

    "Stretch and Challenge is designed to allowthe brightest students the
    opportunity to demonstrate the full extent of their knowledge and skills.
    Stretch and Challenge questions will support the awarding of A* grade at A
    Level, addressing the need for greater differentiation between the most able
    students. "


    I don't know how "stretch and challenge" can be properly translated into
    Vietnamese. 

    Thanks.
