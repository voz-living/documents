    Hanoi is a beautiful city and after a long time, finally I have got a chance
    to visit it. We had some business in Hanoi for a week, not so much time but
    it was enough for both of us to get some interesting experiences. Our plane
    landed at the NoiBai airport early in the morning. After some check-in
    procedures at the airport, we got out and started our trip. The airport is
    located 28 miles from the city center so we had 2 options of catching either
    taxis or buses to get there.Our guide-book said the bus stop was just on the
    right side of the terminal exit and we found it quite easily because of its
    unique color : yellow and red. We caught bus number 07, it went from the
    airport to Kim Ma bus station. We jumped in and told the driver where we
    needed to go but unfortunately, he didn’t understand what I said. Another
    driver came closer and gave me two tickets , “TWO PEOPLE” “TEN” he smiled,
    showed his ten fingers and said to us, which meant, we had to pay ten
    thousand VND for two tickets. Quite cheap! There was a few people on the bus
    too, all of them were Vietnamese so I tried to talk with one young girl who
    sat above us. We thought “she is young and maybe she can speak English”.
    Luckily, her English was quite good and she showed me where “NGA TU SO” was
    and how to get there. The girl said we need to stop at “CAU GIAY” and catch
    another bus. Our new office was located at 131 NGUYEN TRAI and she said it
    was close to “NGA TU SO” so we could walk there easily. We also had a small
    talk about Vienam with that girl, how interesting it is and some places we
    must see in Hanoi like HOAN KIEM LAKE, the Temple of Literature, Ngoc Son
    Temple, West Lake and many, many other places. The bus took us an hour to
    get to the city. Traffic in Hanoi was terrible with tons of motorbikes,
    vehicles, trucks which made me dizzy a bit when I was walkingon the streets.
    However, HANOI has a lot of hidden charms to discover and enjoy (???? you
    should continue this sentence)
