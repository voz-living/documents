Spending two hours a day studying English (no need grammars, listenning... people can understand it) can produce a desirable outcome at school. Even the national exam is not likely to be problematic in this case. \nMoreover, English is the third-most speaking language in the world, especially in the academic domain. Personally, I can take advantage of books, films published in English to improve myself (not sure about 'myself', should I use 'my English'???).\nFinally, English is crucial in workplace nowadays. Having an excellent English spoken skill can greatly improve one's employment.\nIn short, English is the must-have skill for our very survival.\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\nThank you so much \n\nSent from my  using vozForums"
