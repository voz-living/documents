  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI went to a networking event last night. Overall it was good. The topic is how to find and create your own internship in the country and in Southeast Asia. Most of the audience is foreign students while there are few local students and professionals like me <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/shame.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Shame\" class=\"inlineimg\">. I was still shy and struggled a little bit at the beginning but afterwards I enjoyed the meeting. People are nice and very open. At least we had one topic about internship, job, education and career to talk, not chatting about sports, weather, relationship .... like some other events <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/embarrassed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Embarrassed\" class=\"inlineimg\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I still need to improve some aspects as below:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Confidence:</b> I know it&apos;s the key thing. Yeah everybody knows that. Being an introvert, I still feel weird a little bit when catch up and start conversation with strangers. And my English still sucks <img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"> Anyway, I will keep in my mind that people go to networking event to talk and make friends, so be open and people will be open with me <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sexy_girl.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sexy Girl\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Body gesture/position:</b> I need to relax more and more <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/adore.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Adore\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Deep talk:</b> I think small talks are only the beginning to practise, but will lead me nowhere. I need try to brainstorm more to develop conversation, try to connect ideas with people (their countries, schools, jobs, hobbies). There was some awkward moment that I can feel it when me and opposite person did not know what to say something next. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/bad_smelly.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Bad Smell\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Facebook and phone number:</b> People exchange business cards all the time. But next time I will try to get their facebooks and use my phone to call them, let them save my phone number into their phone. It would be better because based on my experience, I don&apos;t give a shit about a a bunch of business cards after leaving event. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/sweat.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sweat\" class=\"inlineimg\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will be another event for professionals in my industry on Thursday but I don&apos;t know I should go or not. The theme is to relax and have drinks together. Not exactly what I like <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/nosebleed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nose Bleedding\" class=\"inlineimg\"> The only positive thing is there would be many HOT girls there lol <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/shame.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Shame\" class=\"inlineimg\"> But it&apos;s not worth it, maybe, especially when I don&apos;t really enjoy that kind of event. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/nosebleed.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nosebleed\" class=\"inlineimg\"> I wish that I had some friends to go together. So going there alone would not be hard anymore <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/burn_joss_stick.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Burn Joss Stick\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t"
