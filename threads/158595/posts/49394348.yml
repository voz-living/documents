  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTalk about job, I&apos;m so confused these days. Back to the year 2007 when I had to choose which university to get in and what to learn in there. I had naturally been thinking of learning something related to technology or mechanic. However, the university I chose was going to National Economics University. The reason was that I&apos;d heard about high salary and good workplace after graduation in the field Economics. Now I&apos;m regretting it. I wish I were strong enough to stand for what I wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question for me now is what to do next. Since I graduated last year and I&apos;m having a job ( not a good one). Should I go and get another chance in the field I have always been dreaming ?\r\n\t\t"
