  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI&apos;ve got an pure friend. Maybe she&apos;s the pourest person in the world. She&apos;s kind,very kind. She&apos;s not so pretty, she&apos;s short, she doesn&apos;t have the popular beauty that everyone like but in my opinion I find in her smt very cute. She&apos;s so smart. She&apos;s the one who probaly the smartest girl in my high-school class. But she doesn&apos;t show off like some smart girls I meet later. She&apos;s never tried to show her smart. She&apos;s so smart that I can&apos;t even talk with her. But somehow I had a little crush on her. I asked her out once when we were at 12th grade in the noel event even I had not talked to her so much be4. And she refused, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went to university in two diffrent ones. She went to the HUST and I went to NEU. Then she studied abroad in France .So we haven&apos;t met for about 7 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn&apos;t really remember why we met again. But It happened about last year. That time I had a lot of problems with my 7-year girlfriend so I asked her out to have some drink, just to have a friend to talk to. We talked and &quot;hell yeah&quot; we had a lot of thoughts in common ( yeah, I used to suit with someone who studied abroad <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">). She&apos;s still like the old days,  still smart, I told her my troubles. And she revealed them in a very simple way,  that I can easily understand. So I talked to her a lot, ask her out everytimes I could, texting her everytimes I had anything coufused. And she always did like above, revealed problems in the simplest way. And sometimes I could help her in some of her little confused problems too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time I was in a quaterlife- crisis, I was so lonely, discouraged I just wanted to have someone to talked, to hug them and have someone hugging me and somehow I found myself missing her, wanted to talked to her everytimes. One day I asked her out and in the way back home, I stopped the motor-bike in a deserted street  and told her:  &quot;Do u know that I want?<br>\r\nI just want some peaceful moment like this&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I said &quot; Can I hug you ?&quot;<br>\r\nShe said in a confusing way: &quot;Eh, I don&apos;t know&quot;<br>\r\nI said: &quot; Just like a friend. I really want to hug someone. I saw &quot;Friends&quot; so many times and I really love how they, friends treat each others.&quot;<br>\r\nShe said: &quot; I don&apos;t know. I can understand u. But If I do this, I still feel sorry with your girl friend&quot;<br>\r\nThen I said&quot; You don&apos;t have to feel anything. I also don&apos;t feel anything too, I just want to do what I want&quot;<br>\r\nAnd I hugged her. Right at that moment, I knew that this hug doesn&apos;t feel like just a friend way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that day, she avoided me. I tried to meet her and said I already liked her. She still so confused. She ask me again and again &quot; Do u think u really like me?&quot; And i said &quot; I don&apos;t think anything I thinked a lot and now I just want to do what my heart are telling me that I wanna be with you&quot;. She don&apos;t said smt spectacularly but she let me hug her. I remembered &quot; when I hold her hands walking in a moutain road of Do Son beach. It&apos;s really peaceful. And I remembered she said &quot;U must do very good things in the previous incarnationu, sothat  I like you now&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after I had her saying that she likes me and she hug me tight suddenly I feel scared. I don&apos;t want to meet her so much like before. I really don&apos;t know why. And I started avoiding her. Didn&apos;t answer her sms. After few times, I did this, she also stop sms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter few months, I tried to go on with my life, discover what I really want. I saw this from her facebook status wall yesterday: &#x200E;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font size=\"3\"><font color=\"Purple\">&quot;1st time: funny proposal with the witness of un ugly dog<br>\r\n2nd time: secret proposal revealed by future mother in law<br>\r\n3rd time: shocking and romantic proposal with roses and wine<br>\r\nYes, I agree. I love you, my love...&#x2665;&quot;</font></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I feel very happy. I feel so happy for her. And I suddenly realize that she&apos;s incredible. And I really want to have her as friend, to share things, problems with her. But I just couldn&apos;t like her. I feel so happy for her, to my wonderful friend girl. She&apos;s the best girl and she deserves the best things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font color=\"Red\"><b>\\\\\\\\Just something I feel I have to write down and share with someone, and by my low level of English in spite of Vietnamese.
