Writing skill in English often is heavily dependent on reading skill. When I first started learning English, I was forced to read tons of books, I think it was like one book a week, by my grandfather (He used to be an English instructor in the army back in days of warring). The best way to improve your writing skill, in my opinion, would be to start reading more books. Reading can help tremendously in solidifying your sense of correct grammar and forming smooth sentences. I can often read a whole sentence and locate precisely the missing components to smooth it out (by saying &quot;smoothing it out&quot; I mean making the sentence easier to read, just like skimming your hand through a thread of silk, smooth and flawless without hiccups). If you think about, reading someone else&apos; works is the same thing as looking at examples of good writing, which I think is the most efficient way to improve your writing skills, just like studying math and the likes, where examples often are much more helpful than just studying theories alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentioned that your reading skill is fine since you had to read the technical documents. I simply think it is not gonna help your writing as much, since those documents are so dry and technical, there will not be a lot of sentence formations and grammar involved. You need to read something more interesting, something that can spikes out the urge to create a work of your own perhaps. You need to find something that contains more feeling to it such as novels, especially epic novels like the &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, which I think is quite hard if you are not used to reading in English. I would recommend &quot;The Kite Runner&quot;, I think you can easily find pdf version of this book on some torrent sites. The more you read, the better your reading skill will get, and guess how that would your writing skill ? YOU CAN PROOFREAD YOUR OWN WRITING !!!! Read more, learn more about sentence forming, how to express your ideas in a more concise manner and avoid unnecessary words, and you will also pick up many new vocabularies along the way. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/feel_good.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Feel Good\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough about reading, let&apos;s talk about speaking. Oh well there isn&apos;t a lot to talk about speaking alone despite the fact that native English speakers often use this skill to better their writing skill, or the be more precise, to check their writing skill. How do they do that ? Just like us Vietnamese, we do not often pay attention to grammar (at least this fact applies to me <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/big_smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\">). We write out what we think up inside our mind, don&apos;t we ? Native English speakers are blessed with a privilege that we, non-native English speakers, will never be able to match. They were born right at the heart of English language, be it American English or British English, they were exposed to the environment where English is the sole survival communication skill. They speak English so fluently that their thoughts can be transformed into writing instead of words coming out of their pipe holes. One of my English professors used to say &quot;If you are unsure about the structure of your sentence, read it out loud&quot;. A native English speaker will hopefully notice any missing component in one sentence just by saying it out loud, pretending the sentence would be a thought that would later transform into sound through speaking. However, speaking skill will only take you so far, because when it comes to advanced writing, the usage of vocabularies, sentence structures and the expression of thoughts become way too complicated to be checked by writers who often communicate verbally through casual styles. Those who can surpass this limitation aren&apos;t alive anymore, at least a majority of them are dead (I am talking about old British people, have you noticed the fancy way of communicating between the British in old movies <img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\">)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy biggest tip for you is to go out there, read more and more and more and you will see the result. Go read two or three books, then come back here, reread your previous comments and see it they would bug the hell out of you or not. One thing you must know is that nothing is perfect, and as you can see, my writing on this thread is quite confusing and not at all grammatical error-proof (Well I wasn&apos;t serious) <img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"images/smilies/brick.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brick\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you ever need any recommendations for books or help with anything else, please let me know either via commenting on this thread or private messaging <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/byebye.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Byebye\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/byebye.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Byebye\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/byebye.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Byebye\" class=\"inlineimg\"><img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/byebye.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Byebye\" class=\"inlineimg\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my hands hurt after typing all of that kakakakakaka (I guess you are older than me since I am still in school finishing up my college degree in biochemistry and heading towards medical school next year)\r\n\t\t"
