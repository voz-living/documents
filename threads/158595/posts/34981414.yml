It&apos;s not easy to answer, but there&apos;re some steps you need to follow if you want to find a half of yours. Firstly, you must have some information about the girl that you&apos;re interested in such as phone number, nickname, address, birthday, hobby, etc... That&apos;s a basic information you must know when you want to make friend or pay attention to her. You can talk, chat with her or even her friends to get those kind of information. After that, when you and that girl have already known each other, you can move to second step - flirt. In this step, you need to prepare a lot of things like gift, flower. Do you know a sudden present always make girls feel surprising. Sometimes, going outside to a park or cinema is a good idea too. And when you have a closer relation with her, third step is ready for you. Third step is final step and I believe this is the most important part because this is a moment you express yourself. Therefore, you have to make sure that you choose a right time to do it. A romantic or your own favorite place is a good suggestion for you and if everything is fine after you express your love to her, maybe a kiss will make both of you happier. It&apos;s always hard when you want to win a girl&apos;s heart, but I strongly believe if you follow above steps, you will have a worth ending.<br>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\r\n\t\t"
