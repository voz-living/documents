  html: "\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI really hate teamwork, in my case, teamwork mean I do everything while others do nothing. I always have to deal with the loads of work that in other groups, 4 or 5 people do it together. Sometimes I feel sad, I always do the task with the best responsibility I have, but my teammates show that they do not care about it and think that it is my duty. I really want some changes in the next year, which I can belong to the better group. <br>\r\nFurthermore, my life recently become chaos when I fall in love with a classmate, but I think my action is too fast. Last Monday, I dont know why I call her for having a meal with me. I doubt that she know my thoughts and she refuse my invite. I think I need more time to talk with her, and the real chance will come to me.\r\n\t\t"
