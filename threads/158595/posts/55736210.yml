    You may not be aware of this, but Kim Jong-Il was the world's greatest
    golfer... According to an official government handout marking his 62nd
    birthday, Kim celebrated by demolishing a par 72 course in just 34 strokes,
    managing a world record five holes-in-one on the way. To top it all, the
    superhuman round was apparently the first time he had actually played the
    sport.
