The first one is who taught me when I was in university. The 2nd one is my for teacher when I was in elementary school. My university teacher&apos;s home is at Tan Phu Disctrict. When I came to see her, She had a little surprise because I came without messaging. She is now happier than before. She is loved by a lot of students and it makes me feel peaceful. <img src=\"/images/smilies/Off/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\"> Of course, I have a small gift for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the second teacher was not at home when I came. It&apos;s my fault when I hadn&apos;t asked her before I came. Then I just have time to wish her a happy 20/11 via phone and see her another day. You know, memory comes back when I rode on Truong Chinh and 1A Highway. I still remember the time when I was a freshman and have military training class at District 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk 1...2...3...thank you, my friends. Have a nice day.\r\n\t\t"
