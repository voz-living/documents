I don&apos;t quote any post here because it would be irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly we have to make it clear that PASSIVE VOICE means someone has done something to/against you, it does not mean someone had &quot;forced&quot; you to do something. Thus any action that was caused by force shall not be expressed in passive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, &quot;I was thought to be rich&quot; is equal to &quot;someone thought that I am rich&quot;, not &quot;I was forced to think that I am rich&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- *** ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly I do agree that &quot;to intend&quot; can be use in passive voice, for example:<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIt is inteded to be a gay party\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This sentence is 100% idiot-proof. The meaning is that the organisers want to hold a gay party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not in the following example:<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHe is intended to get married this month.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->In this case the meaning of the message is very blur and people will find it very difficult to catch the meaning of the verb &quot;intend&quot;. What is the speaker trying to tell? The following messages would have delivered the idea better:<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHe is expected to get married this month (his parents expect that).<br>\r\nHe is planned to get married this month (his parents plan for him).<br>\r\nHe is asked to get married this month (his parents ask him to).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Another example: The following message seems to be ok<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tI was intended to be a girl.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->But actually nobody will use &quot;to intend&quot; in this case but &quot;to expect&quot; instead<br>\r\n<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->\n<div style=\"margin:20px; margin-top:5px; \">\r\n\t<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom:2px\">Quote:</div>\r\n\t<table cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"voz-bbcode-quote\">\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t\t<td class=\"alt2\" style=\"border:1px inset\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tI was expected to be a girl.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\n<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->--- *** ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn conclusion, the passive voice of &quot;to intend&quot; shall not be used on the subject that can &quot;act&quot; for itself. It also means that the original poster was definitely making a mistake when saying &quot;I am intended to ...&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope this will be cleared.
